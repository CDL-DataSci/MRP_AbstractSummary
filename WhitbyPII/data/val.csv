Ms. Clayton advised the Lynde House  has only been open to the public for special events during the past few  years, but has generated great recognition as an 1812 era  home. Margaret expressed hope that the Log Cabin and Puckrin House  would be retained and indicated her understanding that the interiors  could be adapted to other purposes and that LACAC would be pleased   Special Council Minutes   May 13, 2013 -5:30 PM    to provide assistance regarding repurposing of the buildings. The Lynde  House has a heritage history that dates to the War of 1812. The Cullen  family made significant efforts to restore the building and Whitby is  fortunate to boast this heritage home. It would be preferable to relocate  Lynde House to other public lands in Cullen park; however, if this is not  possible, LACAC would support the move of Lynde House to Brock and  Burns Street as part of a heritage museum.    Resolution No. 233-13    Moved By Councillor Emm  Seconded By Councillor Coe    That Council move into Committee of the Whole.    CARRIED  3.

P. LeBel, Commissioner  of Community Services and Marketing indicated discussions were held  in relation to estimated costs and any request for financial support would  have an impact on the budgets of these organizations. Clarification was  sought regarding the estimated cost to relocate Lynde House and  renovate the existing washroom at the main building at Brock and Burns  Street to the Ontario Building Code standards as an accessible public  washroom.  Discussion ensued regarding a proposed museum strategy, long term  costs and the closure of the Whitby Historical Society and subsequent  storage of artifacts. R. Petrie, Chief Administrative Officer confirmed it is  the intent of the Town of Whitby to own the heritage museum and  operate it on a volunteer basis; and that a business plan would be  developed in conjunction with local heritage partners. It may be possible  to access future grants for future projects with these community  partners. P. LeBel, Commissioner of Community and Marketing  Services provided operating cost information for the Pickering Village  Museum facilities and staffing; and for the the Oshawa heritage program  Page 2 of 8  Special Council Minutes   May 13, 2013 -5:30 PM    including Parkwood Estates. Futher discussion ensued regarding the  need for public consultation to determine if the majority of Whitby  residents are interested in a heritage museum. Mr. LeBel advised that  the retention of the three historical buildings was part of the purchase  and sale of the Cullen property and staff is currently dealing with the  proponent; however, if Council direction is received regarding a heritage  museum a public information centre could be held at a future date.

The application is for permission to increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from  20% to 28%.  The requested variance is required to permit the construction of a two storey single  detached dwelling on the subject property, whereas the existing dwelling on the  property is to be removed.  The subject property is located at 123 Baldwin Street and is zoned Residential (R3-BP)  within the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  In Support of Application  Raj Siva (Agent)  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  R. Siva introduced himself to the Committee as the applicant's agent assisting with the  proposed development. He expressed that the only variance required to permit the  dwelling is in respect to lot coverage.  R. Siva advised the Committee that the variance is required to permit the construction of  a larger dwelling which will accommodate a family of 6. As part of the design process,  he considered massing effects on abutting land uses and ensured that the dwelling  complied with all other zoning provisions.  The Chair asked if there were any questions of the Committee.  B. O'Carroll asked if the existing vegetation on the property will be retained.  R. Siva replied that no significant trees will be affected, and he will work with Town of  Whitby Staff with respect to tree preservation if required.  B.

Chronis expressed that Site Plan Approval was granted to construct a two storey  commercial building on the property. To develop the lands in accordance with the  approved Site Plan, three variances are required.  P.

His client is proposing a 1.5m rear yard setback as well as a  new wood privacy fence along the rear lot line, and a chain link fence along the east lot  line. He advised the Committee that the proposed setbacks are appropriate and  respectful of the abutting uses.  D. Harrison asked if the proposed chain link fence can be a wood fence instead.  P. Chronis replied that there is already a wood privacy fence on the Legion's property,  and a chain link fence will be located on the other side of the wood fence on the  applicant's property.  D. Harrison expressed concerns about lighting directed from the east elevation of the  proposed building onto the Legion's property, as well as the location of the proposed  garbage room located adjacent to the east side yard.  P. Chronis advised that any proposed lighting along the east building elevation will be  downward facing. He also expressed that the garbage room can not be moved from its  proposed location.  D. Harrison asked if there will be any residential units within the building.  P. Chronis noted that although the Zoning By-law permits residential uses on the  property, none are proposed.

The Chair asked if there were any questions of the Committee.  B. O'Carroll stated that she has no concerns with the proposed detached garage, but,  asked the applicant why the home based business can not be located within the  dwelling.  M. MacPherson replied that she has three children under the age of 4 and it would be  more ideal to separate the home based business from the dwelling.   Minutes of the 14th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  B. O'Carroll expressed that the second storey of the accessory structure is quite large.  M. MacPherson replied that the floor area of the second storey is a by-product of the  size of the garage located on the ground floor.

She noted that two parking spaces will be located within  the detached garage and additional parking will also be available on the driveway.  B. O'Carroll asked if customer parking on the driveway would impede access to the  parking spaces located within the detached garage.  M. MacPherson replied no.  S. Haslam asked if there will be any overlap in clients attending the business.  M. MacPherson replied that this is possible, but would be infrequent.  J. Cardwell asked the applicant if there will be a washroom or change room in the  accessory structure.  M. MacPherson replied that the storage room located on the second storey of the  accessory structure will eventually be converted to a washroom.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that no correspondence was received.

O'Carroll asked if the area between the neighboring lands to the west and the  townhouse block will have a walkway leading into the site.  M. Luchich replied no.  B. O'Carroll asked if there will be windows on the west elevation of the townhouse  block.  M. Luchich replied that there will be two windows located on the west elevation of the  townhouse block, however, the previous configuration of the townhouse block would  have included many more windows as in its previous configuration the rear yards of the  townhouse units faced the interior (west) lot line.

Highlights of the  presentation included:  • history of climate change in recent years and its impact on  municipal infrastructure;  • long-term impact of climate change which has led to increase in  floods, lyme disease, heat waves, droughts and forest fires in  Durham Region as well as in Canada; and,  • impact of climate change on economic development, local  businesses, and municipal services and infrastructure.

He asked for clarification on  future flooding damage and who would be responsible for the costs. He  Page 2 of 21  Committee of the Whole Minutes   June 10, 2019 - 7:00 PM    requested that the matter related to flooding be resolved prior to the  construction of the building. Mr. Prior suggested that the development in  the Port Whitby area should adopt a tiered approach so that the  buildings would be taller near the GO station and tiered down towards  the harbour front and the lake so as to not obstruct the views of the  existing residents.

He requested the  Council to defer the matter until all items of concern were resolved.

He requested that the owners of sites 708 and 714 Rossland Road East  be permitted to develop buildings that may vary from the suggested  UDP in height and density. Mr. Pereira requested that flexibility for future  Page 5 of 21  Committee of the Whole Minutes   June 10, 2019 - 7:00 PM    developments in terms of height and density be maintained.

He  requested the Council to approve an access road from 712 Rossland  Road East condominium to Teddington Crescent and added that the  UDP be endorsed subject to thorough consultation with the existing  neighbours.   A brief question and answer ensued between Members of the  Committee and Mr. Davis regarding clarification on the open access to  Teddington Crescent.       2.9  Anthony Biglieri and Mike Pettigrew representing Conlin and Anderson  Landowners Group  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 56-19  Conlin Anderson Landowners Group – Brooklin Community Secondary  Plan Area – Comprehensive Block Plan     Refer to Item 4.3, PL 56-19  Anthony Biglieri and Mike Pettigrew, representing the Conlin and  Anderson Landowners Group, appeared before the Committee and  provided a PowerPoint presentation regarding the Brooklin Community  Secondary Plan Area – Comprehensive Block Plan and provided an  overview of the comprehensive block plan layout.

General discussion ensued with respect to population forecasts for the Region of Durham over the next 20 years and it was noted the anticipated growth for the region is considerable. Extensive discussion further ensued with reference to the logistics of realigning the electoral boundaries, the potential impact on the residents of Whitby and the importance of defining a community.

Short, Commissioner of Planning, introduced the report. He explained the government recently circulated a proposed amendment to the Integrated Accessibility Standards regulation (Ontario Regulation 191/11) under the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005 (AODA) and that the Ministry of Community and Social Services is seeking comments on this proposed amendment to the Regulation to include Design of Public Spaces (Accessibility Standards for the Built Environment). He further explained all comments received prior to October 1, 2012 will be considered as part of the decision-making process by the Ministry of Community and Social Services. Detailed discussion ensued regarding the summary of the amendments. R. Short outlined that the standards cover seven different areas relating to the design of public spaces including recreational trails and beach access routes, outdoor public-use eating areas (such as rest stops or picnic areas), outdoor play spaces, exterior paths of travel (i.e. sidewalks and ramps); accessible parking (on and off-street), obtaining services (such as fixed queuing lines and waiting areas) and maintenance. He advised the standards for public spaces will only apply to new construction and planned redevelopment and that enhancements to accessibility in buildings will happen at a later time through Ontario's Building Code. Clarification regarding the timing of when the new standards will come into effect was also discussed and, as noted in the report, staff expressed disappointment with the lack of standardized requirement details provided in the proposed amendment.

Add a Hospice as a permitted use within the Institutional (I) Zone;  The subject property is located at the north east corner of Prince of Wales Drive and  Crawforth Street (Block K, Plan M1133). The property is zoned Institutional (I) within the  Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  In Support of Application  Jeff Solly (Agent)    Mark Murphy (Applicant)  In Opposition of Application  Ted Helps (Resident)   The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  J. Solly introduced himself to the Committee as the representative of VON Durham  Region Community Corporation. He advised the Committee that Council had previously  endorsed the location of the proposed hospice as well as the conveyance of Town land  for the development of the hospice.  J. Solly advised the Committee that the proposed hospice use is institutional in nature  and is similar to a long term care facility use which is currently permitted by the By-law.   With regards to parking, J. Solly noted that a parking rational was completed and  supports the proposed number of parking spaces on the site.   Minutes of the Special Meeting of Committee of Adjustment       J. Solly also noted that the Town identified that the Crawforth Street right of way may be  realigned in the future and therefore advised that a road widening block on the south  portion of the site would be retained by the Town. This resulted in additional minor  variances.   J. Solly further noted that with respect to the loading space variances, in his opinion the  location of the proposed loading spaces is appropriate, and the associated variances  are minor in nature.   The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.   N. Chornobay asked the applicant to provide an overview of the proposed site plan  based on the presentation materials provided by the applicant.   N. Chornobay noted that there is an existing berm on the property along the Prince of  Wales Drive frontage.   J. Solly confirmed the observation, and noted that this area will be regraded and will  also include additional landscaping.   N. Chornobay asked the applicant how many employees the hospice will require.   J. Solly replied that the hospice will have 10 employees during the day and 2 employees  in the evenings.   N. Chornobay asked how many visitors the hospice will generate.   M. Murphy replied that this information is unknown, but in most cases one family  member will be in attendance at all times.   N. Chornobay asked if there will be any outdoor activity space.   M. Murphy replied that there will be a central courtyard for residents and visitors to  enjoy.   N. Chornobay asked if there will be any future expansion to the hospice.   J. Solly replied that the proposed hospice is not anticipated to expand. He noted that  adding additional beds will take away from the small scale character and will become  more institutionalized, which is not their intention.  N. Chornobay asked if the variances are required due to the portion of lands being  retained by the Town.  J. Taylor replied yes, in part. He further noted that the original site to be conveyed to the  applicant was 3 acres. The applicant will only be using 2.35 acres of the property and  the remaining land will be retained by the Town.  D. McCarroll Asked if the entrance will be from Crawforth Street.    Minutes of the Special Meeting of Committee of Adjustment       J. Solly replied yes.   B. O'Carroll asked if the bermed area along the Prince of Wales Drive frontage will have  any landscape features.   J. Solly replied that the main landscape features will be located within the private  courtyard area. However, additional  trees will be planted along Prince of Wales Drive.   B. O'Carroll asked if this landscaping will be in keeping with the existing homes on the  west side of Prince of Wales Drive.   J. Solly replied yes.   N. Chornobay asked what the setback will be from Prince of Wales Drive to the  proposed hospice building.   J. Solly replied approximately 188 feet (57.3m).   The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that no correspondence was received.   The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.  T. Helps introduced himself to the Committee as a resident who resides on Prince of  Wales Drive. He asked if there will be a future expansion to the hospice after it is  constructed. He also expressed concerns with the bermed area that the hospice will  retain abutting the east side of Prince of Wales Drive. His concern was that that hospice  can use this area to expand in the future.   J. Solly replied that the expansion of the proposed building is not contemplated.   M. Murphy noted that the proposed hospice was only designed to be a 10-bed facility,  and they have no plans to expand the use.   S. Haslam advised T. Helps that the expansion of the proposed hospice is not related to  any of the variances being requested.   T. Helps asked if the hospice can dedicate the unoccupied bermed area adjacent to  Prince of Wales Drive back to the Town.   J. Solly replied that they intend to provide a 12m wide strip of land back to the  neighbouring public park, located on the north side of the hospice property. Providing  the landscape strip abutting Prince of Wales Drive back into public ownership would not  be suitable in size for park space.  N. Chornobay asked the applicant if they are proceeding through the Site Plan Approval  process.    Minutes of the Special Meeting of Committee of Adjustment       J. Solly replied yes. He noted that the Site Plan is nearing completion and there have  been no issues raised in regards to the configuration of the proposed hospice building.  N. Chornobay asked the applicant what Site Plan Approval obliges the applicant to do.   J. Solly replied that once Site Plan Approval is granted, they must comply with the  approved plans.   J. Taylor noted that the proposed Site Plan was circulated to the Town of Whitby Parks  Department and they did not have any interest in retaining the bermed area abutting  Prince of Wales Drive.   J. Taylor further noted that this area will include enhanced landscaping and the parking  lot will have full cut-off lighting.   The Chair asked if there was anyone else from the public that wished to speak to the  subject application. There was no one.   Moved by: N. Chornobay  The application to: (1) reduce the minimum required interior/exterior side yard setback  from 10.5m to 6.7m; (2) reduce the minimum required setback of a loading space from  7.5m to 3.7m to a street line; (3) permit a loading space in a front yard or exterior side  yard between the nearest part of any wall of the main building and the front lot line ·or  the exterior side lot line; (4) reduce the minimum required parking ratio from 1 space per  23 sq.m of gross floor area to 1 space per 41 sq.m of gross floor area; and (5) add a  Hospice as a permitted use within the Institutional (I) Zone located at Prince of Wales  Drive be Granted subject to the following conditions:  1. That all Public Works requirements related to Site Plan application SP-19-18 are  complied with; and  2. That a ""hospice"" shall mean a lot and a building(s), or portion thereof used to provide  palliative care and other support services to individuals.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variance is  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.   Minutes of the Special Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Item 3:  Approval of Previous Minutes  Moved by:  B. O'Carroll  That the minutes of the Committee of Adjustment held on Tuesday March  19, 2019 be adopted at the April 11, 2019 Committee of Adjustment  meeting.

He indicated that weekends are particularly busy  times, resulting in on-street parking issues.    A question and answer period ensued between Mr. De Silva and  Members of Council about traffic using streets in the area as a bypass,  opportunities for traffic calming, parking availability in the plaza at the  northeast corner of Garden Street and Taunton Road, turning  movements onto Anderson Street and Garden Street, and opportunities  to balance development density throughout the Town.      4.3  Lori Jackson, Resident  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 47-19  Official Plan Amendment Application OPA-2018-W/05, Zoning By-law  Amendment Application Z-30-18, Site Plan Application SP-44-18 (DEV- 17-18), 7902484 Canada Inc c/o Triovest Realty Advisors, 304, 308,  368, 372, 374 and 378 Taunton Road East  Lori Jackson, 52 Robert Attersley Drive East, appeared before Council  and stated that she had recently received a notice in her mailbox about  another development proposal in her neighbourhood. She indicated that  there are traffic issues on Taunton Road and that the addition of stop  signs on streets in her neighbourhood had not helped reduce traffic or  speeding. She stated that there is insufficient capacity in the road  system to support additional development.   Page 5 of 37  Regular Council Minutes   May 27, 2019 - 7:00 PM    A question and answer period ensued between Ms. Jackson and  Members of Council regarding traffic and speeding in the area, the  height of the proposed buildings, the northern extension of Garden  Street to the future mid-block arterial route, traffic calming opportunities,  and transport trucks and other large vehicles using Robert Attersley  Drive.       4.4  Joanne Brown, Resident  Re: Pickering Airport  Joanne Brown, 28 Erickson Drive, appeared before Council and stated  that the Pickering Airport should not be supported as the project was  comparable in many ways to the Mirabel Airport. She outlined about the  expropriation of the Pickering lands and the impacts to residents. She  stated that the airport will take up prime farmland and will impact natural  areas, including the nearby Rouge National Urban Park. She indicated  that Highway 407 has already bisected the area and could be used to  travel quickly to Toronto Pearson International Airport. She mentioned  that the environmental harm caused by humans has resulted in many  species being at risk and that food security is becoming an issue. Ms.  Brown requested that Council be leaders and not support the airport and  instead support the development of an agricultural tourism program for  the airport lands.            Moved By Councillor Lee  Seconded By Councillor Leahy    That the rules of procedure be suspended to hear additional delegations  from residents regarding Item 6.3, Planning and Development  Department Report PL 47-19.

He indicated that 18 storey buildings are too tall and that the  development is out of character for Whitby.       4.6  Ravi Viswanathan, Resident  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 47-19  Official Plan Amendment Application OPA-2018-W/05, Zoning By-law  Amendment Application Z-30-18, Site Plan Application SP-44-18 (DEV- 17-18), 7902484 Canada Inc c/o Triovest Realty Advisors, 304, 308,  368, 372, 374 and 378 Taunton Road East  Ravi Viswanathan, 31 Donlevy Crescent, appeared before Council and  stated that the proposed 18 storey buildings are out of character for the  surrounding neighbourhood and that they don't represent his view of  how Whitby should look.   A question and answer period ensued between Members of Council and  Mr. Viswanathan about notification for the proposed development, the  process followed by Staff in reviewing applications including  consideration of the Town's Official Plan, density being a reality in all  development applications due to Provincial policy, increasing traffic in  the area including along Taunton Road, and additional communication  opportunities for future official plan amendments.       4.7  Colin Kerr, Resident  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 47-19  Official Plan Amendment Application OPA-2018-W/05, Zoning By-law  Amendment Application Z-30-18, Site Plan Application SP-44-18 (DEV- 17-18), 7902484 Canada Inc c/o Triovest Realty Advisors, 304, 308,  368, 372, 374 and 378 Taunton Road East  Colin Kerr, 42 Robert Attersley Drive East, appeared before Council and  indicated that he is a local teacher. He advised that space is limited in  the Greater Toronto Area and that building vertically is important,  however development must be considered in the context of surrounding  neighbourhoods. He advised that his children attend an area school and  that traffic in the area is unsafe. He advised that a new stop sign in the  area has made things worse and drivers speed to the stop sign and then  speed away from it. He advised that the development proposal will lead  to increased traffic, aggressive driving, u-turns, and driver's failing to  yield to school buses. He advised that Garden Street isn't wide enough  to support this magnitude of development. He indicated that a newly  installed fence around Folkstone Park has increased the risks to  pedestrians as pedestrians now only have a couple of exit points from  the park.   Page 7 of 37  Regular Council Minutes   May 27, 2019 - 7:00 PM    A question and answer period ensued between Members of Council and  Staff regarding the fence installed around Folkstone Park. Staff  explained that this fence was installed as part of the Town's regular  capital program and was a planned improvement for the park.      4.8  Joe Pozderec, Resident  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 47-19  Official Plan Amendment Application OPA-2018-W/05, Zoning By-law  Amendment Application Z-30-18, Site Plan Application SP-44-18 (DEV- 17-18), 7902484 Canada Inc c/o Triovest Realty Advisors, 304, 308,  368, 372, 374 and 378 Taunton Road East  Joe Pozderec, 29 Donlevy Crescent, appeared before Council and  indicated that traffic has increased since he moved to the area. He  advised that density can be achieved through lower height development  spaced closely in one area, as opposed to very tall buildings. He  indicated that planning in Whitby is generally good and cited the plaza at  Garden Street and Taunton Road as being particularly well designed.  He indicated a preference to have Whitby be distinct from other  municipalities.     5.

Ms. Moloney raised additional concerns regarding  the density of the proposed development and disruptions during the  construction phase to surrounding property owners. She stated that the  residential density of the proposed development was 208 units per hectare  and that the Rossland Road/Garden Street Urban Central Area Secondary  Plan permitted a maximum of 110 units per hectare. Ms. Moloney  proposed that a new entranceway onto Teddington Crescent for the  residents of 712 Rossland Road East be established. She further  suggested reducing the height of the proposed tower.

Mr. D'Cunha raised concerns regarding the risk  of overcrowding to nearby schools and provided a summary of the impacts  of overcrowding to students.

He further suggested that a dedicated right  hand turn lane with a yield sign be installed on Rossland Road, turning  north onto Garden Street. He recommended that an assessment be  undertaken with the school boards to assess the capacity of local schools.  He further recommended that the proposed tower be limited to 12 storeys  to be in keeping with neighbouring buildings while allowing for growth.  Kenwyn Richards, Resident, raised concerns regarding the number of  units in the proposed development and whether future studies related to  the development may impact the number of units. Mr. Richards sought  clarification regarding studies conducted that support the proposed  development and who would be held accountable should the studies not  accurately consider the final impacts of the proposed development. He  raised concerns about the Shadow Study and the impacts of shadows  cast by the proposed development on 712 Rossland Road East.  Robert Weindorfer, Resident, raised concerns regarding an increase in  traffic and disruptions due to construction to local residents. Mr.  Weindorfer sought clarification regarding the timeline for completion of the       3  Garden Street/Rossland Road intersection improvements. Mr. Weindorfer  suggested that the applicant engage with the residents at 712 Rossland  Road East by way of a dedicated phone number or email address to  discuss their concerns.

James Black, Resident, raised concerns regarding the quality of life for  local residents as a result of the proposed development.

Adam Layton and Staff answered questions regarding:   details about the Official Plan Amendment 133 and density;   an entranceway to Teddington Crescent for the residents of 712  Rossland Road East;   minimizing shadows and protecting views for residents at 712  Rossland Road East;   the timing of the intersection improvements at Rossland Road and  Garden Street;   the process for assessing school expansions and capacities by the  Durham District School Board and Durham Catholic District School  Board;   reviewing access to Garden Street;   reviewing the Traffic Impact Study to determine whether traffic  calming measures were required along Bassett Boulevard;   requiring addendums to studies should unit counts change;   requiring a Construction Management Plan that addresses dust  and noise suppression;   completing preconstruction surveys to assess conditions of the  area and adjacent properties pre and post construction, and  compensating local property owners for repairs in case of property  damage;   encouraging direct dialogue between the residents at 712 Rossland  Road East and the applicant;       4   requirements for insurance and liability for developers; and,   information about reviewing and approving services such as water,  sewer, and storm water management for developments.  Chris Pereira, representing 708 and 714 Rossland Road East, raised  concerns regarding the placement of the proposed buildings and  separation between the proposed tower and future development on his  property. Mr. Pereira stated that the Town of Whitby's Official Plan did not  include separation guidelines for towers. He requested that the proposed  applications for 3115 and 3125 Garden Street not impact the future  development of 708 and 714 Rossland Road East.  There were no further submissions from the public.

Mr. Favit advised that  the proposed development was in the lower range of the low density  residential polices for the area, and that the proposed development was  in keeping with the existing homes on Hanover Court. He stated that the  proposed development would provide a benefit to the neighbourhood  with the construction of the required safety berm and noise fence along  the northern limit adjacent to the existing Canadian Pacific Railway. Mr.  Favit advised that consultation has taken place with residents of  Hanover Court via two voluntary public open houses in November 2016  and December 2020. He noted that further discussions have taken place  with the adjacent homeowners of 26, 30 and 31 Hanover Court to  address their concerns about the restoration of driveways and front  yards due to the proposed removal of the existing cul-de-sac fronting  their properties.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Mr. Favit regarding:  • whether any discussions with residents from Hanover Court have  taken place since December 2020; and,  • consulting with residents located at 19 and 30 Hanover Court and  any other residents that may have concerns or questions.

Mr. Miller noted that as part of the Zoning By-law Amendment  approval Council had requested that the Site Plan Application be  presented to Council for consideration. He stated that the stormwater  Page 3 of 21  Committee of the Whole Minutes   June 07, 2021 - 7:00 PM    designs for the property were previously presented to the Committee in  detail. He advised that the engineering design for the proposed  development would alter the current stormwater runoff from the site. Mr.  Miller advised that the engineering proposal would remain the same,  nothing the reduction in the 2, 10, and 100-year stormwater runoff from  the proposed development to the lots on Lupin Drive He stated that prior  to the urbanization of Craydon Road there was an overland water flow  route for a small isolated portion of Craydon Road, and that he was  working with Town Staff to determine whether the overland water flow  route still exists. Mr. Miller advised that that the existing buildings on the  property would not impact the water flow route should the overland  water flow route still exist. He noted that accommodations would be  made as necessary to ensure that the additional buildings would not  impact the water flow route. He further advised that he would continue to  work with Town Staff to determine a satisfactory solution, and would  provide whatever easement was required as part of the site plan  agreement with the Town. Mr. Miller stated that he understood that there  were questions about the proposed building setbacks from the dwellings  on Lupin Drive, the screening of the site from the buildings on Lupin  Drive, and possible damage to trees on neighbouring properties. He  advised of a recent in-person site visit, and confirmed that there would  be a separation of more than 15 metres between the future dwellings  and the existing dwellings on Lupin Drive. Mr. Miller advised that the  were only 2 trees in the rear yards of properties on Lupin Drive with  limited growth extending over the fence, noting that it was anticipated  that any work on the Craydon Road properties would have little to no  impact on those trees. He advised that his client was prepared to  consult with the homeowners prior to the commencement of  construction and to monitor any impact on the trees through the  construction process. He further advised that his client was prepared to  use air spading to expose the tree roots and to selectively prune roots  as required in order to eliminate the construction impact on those trees.  Mr. Miller stated that in order to deal with the common property line and  future screening his client was prepared to remove and replace the  existing privacy fence with a new privacy fence. In addition, the  landscape treatment would include oak trees or similar plantings that  would provide greater screening between the two properties. Mr. Miller  noted that the proposed development conforms with the Town of Whitby  Official Plan and the Zoning By-law. He advised that the nearest building  wall on the Craydon Road property site would be approximately 36  metres away from the rear building wall of the Dundas Street property,  and that their site visit confirmed that there was a cedar hedge in the  rear yard of the Dundas Street property which would obscure the view of  the new building from that property. Mr. Miller noted that the drip line of  the cedar hedge crosses the fence in a relatively minor way, and that it  Page 4 of 21  Committee of the Whole Minutes   June 07, 2021 - 7:00 PM    was anticipated that the root zone of those trees would only occupy a  limited area on the Craydon Road property. He advised that his client  would like to meet with the resident on Dundas Street prior to  construction, would monitor any impact of construction on the cedar  hedge, and that he was prepared to use air spading to expose the roots  and selectively prune any roots that may be on the Craydon Road  property to diminish any construction impact on the cedar hedge. Mr.  Miller advised that his client was intent on resolving development issues  that may arise to the satisfaction of the Town of Whitby. He stated that  he and his client have read and were in support of the staff  recommendation.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee,  Mr. Miller, and Mr. Raponi regarding:  • confirmation that the intent was to provide an effective landscape  screening between the abutting properties on Lupin Drive and the  proposed buildings to eliminate overlook from the buildings into  the rear yards on Lupin Drive;  • where the stormwater swale drains to on Lupin Drive; and,  • confirmation that mitigation measures would be undertaken to  prevent any damage to the cedar hedge located on Dundas  Street.  It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 4.5, PL 36-21, at  this time.      2.5  Steve Edwards, Beth Halpenny and Steven Silverberg representing  Cedar City Seaboard Gate Inc.  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 39-21   Draft Plan of Subdivision and Zoning By-law Amendment Applications,  Seaboard Gate and Vista Beach Court, Cedar City Seaboard Gate Inc.,  File Numbers: DEV-02-21 (SW-2021-01, Z-02-21)     Refer to Item 4.7, PL 39-21  Steve Edwards, Beth Halpenny, and Steven Silverberg representing  Cedar City Seaboard Gate Inc., stated that they have read and were  agreement with the staff recommendation. Mr. Edwards stated that one  of the Draft Plan Conditions indicated that two (2) non-garage parking  spaces would be provided at all corner lots. He noted the potential for  issues related to zoning and urban design and requested that Town  Staff participate in working through this condition.   Beth Halpenny advised that an informal public meeting and a statutory  public meeting were held for these applications, noting that it was clear  residents in the neighbourhood wanted the impact and duration of  Page 5 of 21  Committee of the Whole Minutes   June 07, 2021 - 7:00 PM    construction to be minimized and as short of a duration of time as  possible. She advised that the engineering design approvals were  submitted to the Public Works Department, that the subdivision was  straight forward and would consist of 39 units, and that the subdivision   would tie into existing infrastructure on Seaboard Gate. She noted that  she was hopeful for an expeditious review and approval in order for  servicing and paving to be completed prior to the end of the year.    A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee, Mr. Edwards, Ms. Halpenny, and Mr. Silverberg regarding  discussions that took place at the public meetings about pedestrian  access to Portage Park.

He  advised that there were a number of trees planted by the Highway of  Heroes Tree Campaign around Intrepid Park and that there was access  along the routes that most residents would travel on to go to the  waterfront. Mr. Boychyn stated Whitby has two legions which  commemorate and perpetuate the memory of the fallen and currently  serving members. He raised concerns about the location for the park  being near to and above the old water treatment area, the accessibility  to the area and the limited number of parking spaces. Mr. Boychyn  noted that the provision of only 17 parking spaces would necessitate  school children visiting the area to disembark from school buses along  Victoria Street. He raised further concerns about washroom facilities not  being provided on site. Mr. Boychyn stated that he believes that this  type of commemoration was appropriate, but that he has concerns  about the amount of spending on maintenance costs when such support  could be better provided for residents, active members and veterans in  Whitby. He advised that he was not opposed to a memorial, but that this  proposal was not a well planned or consulted plan. He stated that the  purpose of the Highway of Heroes Tree Campaign was to  commemorate those that came and were repatriated from Afghanistan  and that the campaign should remain true to that purpose as opposed  expanding it to what may conceivably be one of a tremendous number  of campaigns that have existed, noting that there were any number of  battles that should be commemorated. Mr. Boychyn suggested further  development of the Cenotaph to honour the veterans instead of another  location where people may not visit. He commented on the park not  being well attended unless there was signage arching over the Highway  of Heroes indicating the park exists in Whitby. He stated that there were  other parks within that geographical location that would be more suitable  for families. Mr. Boychyn stated that there should be a greater amount of  consultation and thought about what would be achieved for the residents  and veterans in Whitby.  A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Mr. Boychyn regarding one improvement that could be  made from the delegate's perspective.      7.2  Hildert Harding  Re: Public Works Department Report, PW 17-21  Page 14 of 21  Committee of the Whole Minutes   June 07, 2021 - 7:00 PM    Vimy Memorial Park     Refer to Item 9.1, PW 17-21   Hildert Harding, 54 Harvey Johnston Way, stated that his only concern  was related to the location of the Vimy Memorial Park due to noise  emanating from Highway 401 and the Canadian Pacific Railway on both  sides of the park.

Highlights of the presentation included:  • the definition of intensification as defined by the Province and the  Town, and the definition of density as defined in land use  planning;  • the drivers of intensification and density;  • the establishment of intensification areas and corridors within the  Town's built boundary through Whitby's Official Plan;  • the intensification corridors comprised of portions of regional  corridors, including Dundas Street, Taunton Road, Brock  Street/Baldwin Street, Victoria Street, Winchester Road, and  Columbus Road;  • the minimum height for new residential and mixed-use buildings  in intensification corridors, and the preferred location of buildings  that have a height between four and eight storeys;  • the intensification areas in Whitby;  • the criteria for proposals for medium and high density residential  development and redevelopment intensification outside of the  intensification corridors;  • opportunities and benefits of properly planned intensification;  • the various challenges associated with infill intensification;   • the role of staff to assess and determine whether a proposal for  new residential infill or intensification project meets the intent of  the policies of the Town's Official Plan and evaluation criteria;  • preliminary considerations for intensification guidelines including  height, density, tower design and setbacks;  • the compatibility of development with the surrounding  neighbourhood;  • examples of existing and recently approved intensification  developments at various locations in Whitby; and,  • various short, medium and long term recommendations to  achieve an open, collaborative process where residents can  Page 2 of 9  Committee of the Whole Minutes   January 20, 2020 - 7:00 PM    participate and have their voices heard.  A detailed question and answer period ensued between Members of  Council and Staff regarding:  • the implications of not meeting intensification targets established  through policy;  • whether developers have provided feedback on current and  proposed processes for community participation;  • providing clarity to developers on the expectation of Council and  staff to undertake a pre-meeting with residents prior to the Public  Meeting, and to include whether or not a pre-meeting took place  within the introductory report;  • the developers hosting a secondary community meeting following  the Public Meeting to review concerns raised at the meeting;   • including details related to current height and density permissions  for the development area within the introductory report;  • providing information to residents prior to the submission of an  application that would provide the rationale for the growth in  Whitby, the stages of the planning process, how the public may  participate, and what residents could expect;   • informing residents about the implications of an appeal to the  Local Planning Appeal Tribunal;  • the possibility of setting out design guidelines for specific  development sites versus the redesign of a development at  various stages of the process;   • whether the requirement for an urban design plan for higher  height/density development applications was standard practice  and the benefits associated with this requirement;  • tracking the quantity and location of higher height/density  development to provide fairness, transparency and a better  understanding of development across the Town for residents;   • the benefits of high density residential areas on the tax base to  support services, and whether that benefit would be equivalent to  the commercial and industrial impact on the tax base;  • the development of a detailed set of guidelines to assist in the  review of development applications for high density and  intensification; and,  • the timeline for a report to be presented to Council.    2.  Delegations    2.1  David McKay, MHBC Planning Limited  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 4-20  Official Plan Amendment Application and Zoning By-law Amendment  Application, 70 Taunton Road East, Dymon Capital Corporation, File  Page 3 of 9  Committee of the Whole Minutes   January 20, 2020 - 7:00 PM    DEV-22-18 (OPA-2018-W/04, Z-26-18)     Refer to Item 4.1, PL 4-20  David McKay, MHBC Planning Limited, appeared before the Committee  and advised that he was in support of the staff recommendation. He  stated that modifications to the proposed development were made to  address comments received from the public at the Public Meeting.  It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 4.1, PL 4-20, at this  time.      2.2  Kevin Lauzon, Laark Enterprise Ltd. (Tim Hortons)  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 6-20  Sign By-law Variance to Permanent Sign By-law for 516 Brock Street  North (Tim Hortons) File No. SB-04-19     Refer to Item 4.3, PL 6-20  Kevin Lauzon, Laark Enterprise Ltd. (Tim Hortons), appeared before the  Committee and requested support and approval for the replacement of  an existing menu board sign that was not repairable. Mr. Lauzon  advised that Tim Hortons had adopted a new signage strategy for their  drive-throughs which would use digital menu board signs, noting that the  Tim Hortons located at 501 Dundas Street West currently has a digital  menu board sign. He provided a number of reasons to approve the  exception to the current by-law including the replacement of an existing  structure, the differences between the lighting of the current and new  sign which would result in eliminating light casting into the neighbouring  properties, and the ability to digitally change the menu options for the  new sign which would eliminate potential hazards to staff when manually  changing the menu board in inclement weather. Mr. Lauzon raised  concerns that Tim Hortons would no longer support the point of sale  material for the current menu board sign and that he would not be able  to keep his menu pricing current. He advised that the drive-through  wraps around Jiffy Lube, noting that the sign was barely visible from the  street and was concealed from passing traffic. He further advised that  the menu board sign does not promote his business as customers have  already made the decision to enter the drive-through. Mr. Lauzon stated  that this was the only drive-through located within the boundary of  Downtown Whitby, noting that granting an exception to the by-law on  that basis would not provide an opportunity for other business to request  such an exception.   A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Council and Mr. Lauzon regarding whether the menu board sign would  Page 4 of 9  Committee of the Whole Minutes   January 20, 2020 - 7:00 PM    be the same as the menu board sign board at the Dundas Street  location, and whether there have been any complaints from the  residents in the area of the Dundas Street location.  It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 4.3, PL 6-20, at this  time.    3.  Correspondence    3.1  Durham Region Transit Update  Chair Mulcahy provided details regarding the cancellation of some of the  Durham Region Transit (DRT) bus routes between December 2019 and  January 2020 due to the inability to meet peak vehicle requirements for  buses. She provided an update regarding the impact on Whitby  residents and details on measures undertaken including mitigating the  impact to customers, ensuring customers were aware of the temporarily  cancelled trips in order to use alternative routes, fleet adjustments to  allocate the maximum availability, and DRT's provision of ongoing  management and support to the contracted service providers. Chair  Mulcahy advised that as of January 17, 2020 the actions undertaken  have reduced the number of last minute route cancellations. She stated  that the contracted service provider implemented several measures to  address the availability of buses. She advised that Routes 302 and 305  would be reinstated once DRT was confident that the contracted service  provider was able to sustain the required bus availability.      4.  Staff Reports    4.1  Planning and Development Department Report, PL 4-20  Re: Official Plan Amendment Application and Zoning By-law  Amendment Application, 70 Taunton Road East, Dymon Capital  Corporation, File DEV-22-18 (OPA-2018-W/04, Z-26-18)  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Council and  Staff regarding the concerns raised by the adjacent commercial plaza  owned by SmartCentres with respect to the existing easement on their  property and access rights between the two properties.

That Council approve an amendment to Zoning By-law # 1784  (File: Z-26-18), and that a By-law to amend Zoning By-law # 1784  be brought forward for consideration by Council;   3. That the Clerk forward a Notice to those parties and agencies  who requested to be notified of Council's decision; and,  4. That the Clerk forward a copy of the Planning Report PL 4-20,  two (2) copies of the adopted Amendment, and a copy of the by- law to adopt Amendment Number 117 to the Whitby Official Plan,  to the Region of Durham's Commissioner of Planning and  Economic Development.    Carried    It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 2.2, Delegation by  Kevin Lauzon, at this time.    4.2  Planning and Development Department Report, PL 5-20  Re: Town of Whitby Tree Protection Guidelines: 2020 Update     This item was withdrawn.      4.3  Planning and Development Department Report, PL 6-20  Re: Sign By-law Variance to Permanent Sign By-law for 516 Brock  Street North (Tim Hortons) File No. SB-04-19  A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Council and staff regarding the location of the new menu sign board on  the subject property and the visibility of the sign from the street.      Recommendation:    Moved By Mayor Mitchell    That Council approve the request for a variance and a site specific  amendment to the Town of Whitby Permanent Sign By-law # 7379-18  for Tim Hortons at 516 Brock Street North based on consideration of the  unique circumstances associated with the application, given that the  proposed signs will primarily be visible to persons who enter the Tim  Hortons property for the purpose of accessing the drive-through.     Carried  Page 6 of 9  Committee of the Whole Minutes   January 20, 2020 - 7:00 PM      It was the consensus to hear Item 3.1, Correspondence, at this time.    Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Roy    That the rules of procedure be suspended to introduce a motion  regarding Expanded Paid Parking at Go Rail Stations due to its time  sensitive nature.    Carried on a Two Thirds Vote  5.  New and Unfinished Business - Planning and Development    5.1  Expanded Paid Parking at GO Commuter Rail Stations  Councillor Roy introduced a motion regarding expanded paid parking at  GO Commuter Rail Stations.  Discussion ensued between Members of Council regarding:  • consultation with Metrolinx on the proposed parking  modernization program;  • the current availability of parking at the Iroquois Park Sports  Centre;  • the possible financial impact to the municipality, and the revenue  from the paid parking that would be received by the municipality;  • informing residents about how they would be impacted by paid  parking;   • the implications of implementing a parking fee for residents using  GO Rail;   • the lack of transit to support Whitby residents, and how residents  would get to the GO Rail Station without driving a vehicle;  • the possibility of residents being forced to use transit versus  driving due to the cost of parking, and the opportunity to offer a  package for transit to residents that reside in close proximity to  the GO Rail Station;  • the inability for future residents of Whitby to park their vehicles at  the GO Rail Station,   • the opportunity to lower the fee for using the train should there be  a fee for parking; and,  • understanding the scope of the plan, and when the plan would be  implemented.      Page 7 of 9  Committee of the Whole Minutes   January 20, 2020 - 7:00 PM    Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Roy    Whereas the proposed parking modernization program being  considered by Metrolinx is expected to result in an increase in paid  parking spaces in Metrolinx parking lots near GO Commuter Rail  Stations;       Whereas the conversion of free parking spaces to paid parking spaces  in Metrolinx parking lots may result in commuters choosing to drive to  work for financial reasons, rather than taking public transit, thereby  increasing the number of vehicles on Greater Toronto Area highways;        Whereas the implementation of additional paid parking spaces may  result in impacts to surrounding communities due to motorists seeking  out free parking, which could result in an increase to on-street parking  and parking in nearby public and private parking lots; and,      Whereas the Town has worked collaboratively with Metrolinx for shared  parking arrangements near the Whitby GO Station, and any decision to  implement paid parking spaces in Metrolinx parking lots will impact the  availability of parking spaces at the Iroquois Park Sports Centre.     Now Therefore be it Resolved:       1. That Staff be directed to engage with Metrolinx about their  proposed parking modernization program;    2. That the Council of the Town of Whitby can only support the  expansion of paid parking at the Whitby GO Station subject to  Metrolinx undertaking consultation with the Town and the  community, and an understanding of the impacts these changes  will have, including financial impacts, on local GO Transit  ridership; and,    3. That the Clerk be directed to forward a copy of this resolution to  Durham Area Municipalities, M.P.P. Lorne Coe, the Hon. Caroline  Mulroney, and Metrolinx.     Carried    Adjournment      Motion to Adjourn    Page 8 of 9  Committee of the Whole Minutes   January 20, 2020 - 7:00 PM      Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Lee    That the meeting adjourn.

Carried    8.5  Municipal Housing Pledge  Discussion ensued between Members of Council regarding concerns with  Envision Durham and the importance of public consultation.   Resolution # 67-23  Moved by Councillor Lee  Seconded by Councillor Leahy  Whereas on October 25, 2022 the Minister of Municipal Affairs and  Housing issued a letter to the Town of Whitby recognizing the Province's  commitment to build 1.5 million homes by 2031 and assigning a Municipal  Housing Target of 18,000 new homes in Whitby to assist with achieving  this target.       8  And whereas, the Minister also requested the Town to demonstrate its  commitment to accelerating housing supply by developing a Municipal  Housing Pledge and take the necessary steps to facilitate the construction  of 18,000 new homes in Whitby by 2031, and delivering that pledge to the  Minister by March 22, 2023.  And whereas, the Town has a considerable inventory of housing units  approved or in the approval process (i.e. 18,118 units), including 4,123  low density, 4,925 medium density and 9,070 high density units.  And whereas, the Town has additional greenfield land inventory within the  West Whitby and Brooklin Community Secondary Plan areas to  accommodate draft plan of subdivision applications, and considerable  infill/intensification opportunities, which will further increase the potential  housing yield.  And whereas, the Town has experienced a considerable increase in the  number of building permits for residential units in the recent past, including  2,360 permits in 2021 and 1,777 permits in 2022, with an expectation to  continue such volume of permits into the future.  Now therefore, the Town of Whitby Council pledges its commitment to  facilitate the development of 18,000 new homes by 2031 through the  following initiatives/activities:   Implement and/or update Official Plan Policies, including the  following:  o Continue to implement recent Official Plan policy adjustments to  increase the proportionate share of medium and high density  residential units in strategic areas of the Town, such as  designated Centers, Corridors and the Whitby GO Station and  Port Whitby areas;  o Initiate an update to the Town of Whitby Official Plan to comply  with recent changes to the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden  Horseshoe and pending new Official Plan for the Region of  Durham;  o Initiate an update to strengthen the policy basis for medium and  high density residential units within the Whitby GO Major Transit  Station Area (MTSA).   Complete the on-going Comprehensive Review and Update of the  Town's Zoning By-laws, including the following:       9  o Including permissive policies to support accessory units in  ground related housing forms;  o Including contemporary regulations to accommodate a wide  range of housing types as-of-right.   Develop a Housing Acceleration Strategy and Implementation Plan,  including such matters as the following:  o Confirmation and/or expansion of strategic development areas  designated in the Whitby Official Plan;  o Recognition of updated/contemporary zoning regulations  through the Comprehensive Zoning By-law Review and Update;  o Development of municipal fiscal resources to support the cost of  new housing and related infrastructure;  o Co-ordinate with the Region of Durham to develop a servicing  plan to accommodate new growth in Whitby;  o Identification of public lands with development or redevelopment  potential.   Capitalize on funding sources, such as the Streamline  Development Fund to further advance on-line portal development  for Planning Act and Ontario Building Code Act related  applications, recognizing the on-line application resources have  been established and will continue to be expanded upon.   Continue to collaborate with the Region of Durham to ensure major  servicing infrastructure (water, sewer, roads) is available when  needed.  Notwithstanding the Town of Whitby's Municipal Housing Pledge herein, it  is recognized that there are many influences outside the control of the  Town, which should not reflect upon the Town's performance to achieve  the Municipal Housing Target of 18,000 homes by 2031, including but not  limited to the following:   Interest rates;   Inflation;   Supply chain issues;   Availability of labour force/skilled trades in housing construction;       10   Housing market;   Developer's desire to proceed with construction;   Provision of Regional infrastructure;   Planning approvals shifting to the Provincial level from the Region  of Durham;   Additional, unforeseen legislative changes to planning and building  approvals processes;   Shortage of talent pool for Planning, Engineering and Building  professionals required to review and process development  applications.  The Council of the Town of Whitby makes this pledge recognizing that  there is a shared responsibility with the development community to deliver  on the creation of desirable communities where residents can live, work  and play, not just live.  Also recognizing that they Town's responsibility to  support new and existing residents will remain long after the new housing  is constructed.  The Council of the Town of Whitby requests further dialogue with the  Province regarding definitions related to Bill 23 and regulations thereto,  and looks forward to further discussions with the Minister of Municipal  Affairs and Housing in April 2023 regarding the impacts of Bill 23, and  related Development Charge shortfalls, what legislative provisions will be  directed at the development community to pass along, dollar for dollar,  any savings achieved through Bill 23, and legislative amendments to  incent developers to ""use it or lose it"" with respect to approved  development applications or permits.  That the Clerk be directed to circulate a copy of this resolution to the  Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, the Regional Municipality of  Durham, Durham Area Municipalities, and all Durham Region MPPs.

New and Unfinished Business - General Government    10.1 Request for Provincial Legislation Related To Excessive Vehicle Noise  Councillor Drumm introduced a motion regarding provincial legislation  related to excessive vehicle noise.  A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Staff regarding requesting the Durham Regional Police  Service to enforce excessive noise over a certain decibel level.      Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Drumm    Whereas according to section 75 of the Highway Traffic Act (HTA),  every motor vehicle shall be equipped with a muffler in good working  order and in constant operation to prevent excessive or unusual noise  and excessive smoke, and no person shall use a muffler cut-out, straight  exhaust, gutted muffler, Hollywood muffler, by-pass or similar device  upon a motor vehicle; and,    Whereas the act of modifying the exhaust system of a motor vehicle is  not currently an offence under the HTA, and as a result muffler and  auto-body shops continue to provide such services to individuals who  choose to modify their vehicles which could negatively impact the safety  of the vehicle; and,    Whereas Durham Regional Police Service has been actively laying  charges pursuant to section 75 of the HTA against motor vehicle  operators whose vehicles make excessive or unusual noise or produce  excessive smoke from muffler systems that have been modified; and,    Whereas Council continues to receive negative feedback about an  increase in noise due to modified vehicles on Regional and local roads;  and,    Whereas on October 28, 2019, the Province of Ontario introduced Bill  132, Better for People, Smarter for Business Act, 2019 which in part  sought to amend the HTA to include a new section 75.1 that will make it  an offence to tamper with motor vehicles by (a) removing, bypassing,  defeating or rendering inoperative all or part of a motor vehicle's  Page 15 of 18  Committee of the Whole Minutes   November 15, 2021 - 7:00 PM    emission control system or (b) modifying a motor or motor vehicle in any  way that results in increased emissions from the level to which it was  originally designed or certified by the manufacturer of the motor or motor  vehicle, as well as prohibit the sale of tampering devices that can create  excessive noise or smoke on our streets and in our neighbourhoods;  and,    Whereas Bill 132 received Royal Assent on December 10, 2019,  however, the Lieutenant Governor has not yet proclaimed section 75.1  of the HTA; and,    Whereas the City of Mississauga, Region of Peel, City of Oshawa and  Town of Ajax have already passed motions calling on the Province of  Ontario to immediately proclaim and bring into force section 75.1 of the  HTA.    Now therefore be it resolved that:     1. That Council urge the Province of Ontario to work with the  Lieutenant Governor to expedite the proclamation of section 75.1  of the Highway Traffic Act (Better for People, Smarter for  Business Act, 2019, S.O. 2019, c. 14, Sched. 16, s. 11);  2. That the Ministry of Transportation be requested to set a  maximum decibel count for exhaust systems to ensure that  exhaust systems with the capability of exceeding 80 decibels will  not be available for sale and will not be permitted in the Province  of Ontario, and consider reviewing and increasing associated  penalties for noncompliance;  3.  The Province of Ontario be requested to provide funding for  police services in Ontario to be equipped with approved decibel  monitor devices to aid in effective enforcement efforts; and,  4. That a copy of this motion be sent to the Hon. Caroline Mulroney,  Minister of Transportation, Lorne Coe, MPP Whitby, all Durham  Region Members of Provincial Parliament, the Region of Durham,  all Durham Region municipalities, Durham Regional Police  Service, and the Ontario Provincial Police.     Carried    10.2 Automated Speed Cameras on Town Roads  Councillor Mulcahy introduced a motion regarding automated speed  cameras on Town roads.  Page 16 of 18  Committee of the Whole Minutes   November 15, 2021 - 7:00 PM    A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Staff regarding:  • the ability to work with the City of Toronto on purchasing  automated speed cameras;  • informing S. Siopis, Commissioner of Works, Region of Durham  about this initiative;  • confirmation that the automated cameras on Town roads would  not be a regional initiative;  • how purchasing devices, placement and installation of devices,  and enforcement would take place;  • clarification on how this program would be considered a service  level increase;   • whether there was a model with respect to cost and  implementation of this program that the Town could obtain from  another local municipality; and,  • providing information about the revenue and effectiveness of the  Region's program.      Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Mulcahy    Whereas Automated Speed Enforcement (ASE) is an automated system  that uses cameras and speed measurement devices to help improve  safety, enforce speed limits and reduce collisions; and,    Whereas on December 2, 2019, the Province of Ontario passed  regulations to allow municipalities to operate an ASE program; and,    Whereas the Region of Durham currently operates an ASE program on  Regional Roads in designated School Safety Zones and Community  Safety Zones within the Town of Whitby in support of Durham Vision  Zero; and,    Whereas Council has a stated goal of making streets and  neighbourhoods safer through innovative and best-practice design  standards and traffic calming measures that reduce traffic speeds.    Now therefore be it resolved:    That staff report to Council on the feasibility and cost of adopting an  Automated Speed Enforcement program on Town Roads in School  Safety Zones and Community Safety Zones.

She stated that it is creating a toll inequity, a hardship for those  businesses that rely on the northbound/southbound highways, and was  unfair to the Durham Region community. Councillor Roy requested that  Mayor Mitchell prepare and send correspondence to the Provincial  Government, copying all municipalities within the Region and the Region  of Durham, regarding the removal of the Highway 412 and 418 tolls.   Mayor Mitchell advised he would send correspondence on behalf of  Whitby Council reaffirming the need to remove the tolls, noting that it  would be an appropriate time to do so given the announcement about  the toll-free Bradford bypass.       Adjournment      Motion to Adjourn      Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Drumm    That the meeting adjourn.    Carried    The meeting adjourned at 9:48 p.m.    Page 18 of 18"

Gaskell,  Chief Administrative Officer  This memo is to advise Council that a draft of the next edition of Ontario's  Building Code (OBC) has been released and comments are being accepted until  March 13, 2022. Staff have reviewed it specific to how the proposed OBC changes  will impact energy performance and greenhouse gas emissions and affect the  Whitby Green Standard and have prepared the following recommendations for  Council's consideration.  Recommendation:  1) That Staff be directed to provide the comments within the memorandum from S. Klein, Director, Strategic Initiatives, dated March 2, 2022 regarding Proposed Changes for the Next Edition of Ontario's Building Code, to the Environmental Registry of Ontario regarding the changes to the Ontario Building Code pertaining to energy performance and greenhouse gas emissions 2) That the Clerk be directed to send correspondence to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing requesting the Province to: • Ensure the adoption of the tiered National Building Code model immediately results in higher Energy Efficiency Requirements across all building types in comparison to the current OBC. • Adopt the National Building Code model that includes the tiered standards alongside a timeframe for advancement to higher tiers to ensure a pathway towards net zero emissions and energy. • Provide authority to municipalities to require increased performance in energy efficiency through the implementation of tiered and advancing Green Standards. Strategic Initiatives Division Agenda Item # 5.2 Page 66 of 209  Page 2 of 4   Facilitate capacity, education and training in the implementation of the Tiered National Building Code model for municipal planning and building inspection staff, developers, and homebuilders to help build capacity in areas such as airtightness testing, building envelope design and building science. 3) That a copy of this correspondence and memorandum be sent to Durham Region municipalities and Ontario's Big City Mayors. Background  The Ontario Building Code is updated approximately every five years. This code sets  out the requirements for new construction, renovation, and change of use of buildings.  The Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing has released a proposal for the next  edition of the Ontario Building Code, which includes how the Province intends to  harmonize with the updated national codes expected to be released in the Fall of 2022.  It is important to note that although the final National Building Code has not been  released, Provincial Governments have been provided with a final version in advance,  and the draft National Building Code is publically available.   Discussion:  The draft National Building Code indicates a tiered approach for energy performance.  This would mean that those with authority over the Building Code could choose to  require or incentivize builders to meet one or more tiers of the Code. This is an alternate  approach to the National Building Code's current prescriptive requirements. This  stepped approach is important as it ensures that new development is advancing and  aligning with energy efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction goals over a period of  time. A stepped approach also allows municipalities to enforce Green Development  Standards through the Building Code Process.  The Environmental Registry of Ontario (ERO) has posted the proposed changes to the  Ontario Building Code and the Province is not proposing a Tiered code; instead, they  are proposing to adopt:  1. Tier 3 requirements of the National Building Code for part 9 buildings.  Part 9 buildings are defined as three or fewer storeys in height and smaller than 600 m2 in area.  Tier 3 for Part 9 buildings would maintain energy efficiency requirements equivalent to the current 2017 Ontario Building Code resulting in no improvements in energy efficiency requirements. 2. Tier 1 requirements of the National Building Code for part 3 buildings.  Part 3 buildings are classified buildings exceeding 600 m2 in building area or exceeding three storeys in building height.  From an energy efficiency perspective, Tier 1 for part 3 buildings would be less stringent than the current 2017 Ontario Building Code and therefore reduce the required energy efficiency of larger buildings. Agenda Item # 5.2 Page 67 of 209  Page 3 of 4  Whitby Green Standard  As of now, the Whitby Green Standard Tier 1 criteria indicates a minimum energy  performance of 15% above the 2017 Ontario Building Code regardless of building  classification. The Whitby Green Standard was developed to align with the proposed  Tiered National Building Code while also aligning with surrounding municipalities that  enact Green Development Standards as part of the development process.   The Province has indicated an 18-month transition to the National Building Code,  meaning that by the time this comes into effect, Whitby would have advanced to version  2 of the Whitby Green Standard and will be requiring 25% increased energy efficiency  above the 2017 Ontario Building Code.   This proposal would put pressure on municipalities to increase the need for minimum  energy standards in Green Development Standards while continuing to prevent  municipalities in having authority to enforce Green Standards through the Building  Code.  Climate Change  Thirty percent of the Region's total greenhouse gas emissions come from buildings. In  2018, Durham households, businesses and other organizations paid $2.5 billion for fuel  and electricity. Electricity comprises 36%, and natural gas is 10% of these total costs  (Durham Community Energy Plan, 2019).   In order to align with local, Regional, Provincial, and Federal government climate goals,  a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions must take place. The proposed Tiered  National Building Code offers the opportunity to outline how these greenhouse gas  reductions will be achieved.  Whitby has developed a Whitby Green Standard to support the development of  complete sustainable communities. Support for Green Development Standards through  the Ontario Building Code will help ensure environmental, social and economic  innovation. It would facilitate an advancing pathway to net zero new buildings by 2032  and allow for deep energy retrofits to take place between now and 2050 in order to  achieve the climate goals for all governmental levels.   The proposed Provincial approach does not align with the Town's, the Province's or the  Federal Government's Greenhouse Gas emission reduction targets.  Affordability  Households that spend more than 6% of their after-tax household income on home  energy services (or roughly twice the national median) have high home energy cost  burdens, and are said to be experiencing energy poverty.  Agenda Item # 5.2 Page 68 of 209  Page 4 of 4  According to the Canadian Urban Sustainability Practitioners Energy Poverty and Equity  Explorer, between 15 – 24% of Whitby households spend more than 6% of their  household income on heating and electricity costs.  Advancing stronger energy efficient Building Code requirements will ensure a reduction  of energy poverty pressures for owners and tenants of both new development and  retrofitted buildings. Sustained funding programs should be offered to bridge the gap  between standard building methods and green standard building methods for qualifying  affordable housing projects.  Studies show that energy efficient buildings have a quick payback meaning that the  increased cost to build or retrofit an energy efficient home will result in offsetting energy  savings over a number of years. It is more cost effective to build energy efficient homes  new than completing deep energy retrofits on existing buildings. However, all buildings  need to be upgraded to meet energy and climate pressures and by not advancing  energy efficiency standards in the Building Code, this will add future energy and retrofit  costs onto taxpayers in the future.  The Town recognizes the housing affordability crisis and by not increasing energy  efficiency improvements, one of the root issues of operational affordability for  homeowners will not be addressed.   Agenda Item # 5.2 Page 69 of 209                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Memorandum to Council  Planning and Development Department  Engineering Services  To:  Mayor and Members of Council  CC:  Roger Saunders, Commissioner, Planning  and Development  Acknowledged by M. Gaskell,  Chief Administrative Officer  From:  Peter Angelo,  Director of Engineering Services,  Planning and Development  Date:  February 18, 2022  File #:  SW-2019-01 Madison Development  Subject:  Madison Development – Ministry of  Transportation (MTO) Comments  As requested by the Committee of the Whole on February 14, 2022, the following memo  provides additional information regarding the Stormwater Management (SWM) Outfall  related to the Madison Subdivision Development.  The Madison Development is located at the northeast corner of Baldwin Street South  and Highway 407 East, abutting Lynde Creek Valley, along the east development limits.  The Draft Plan for this development was approved at the June 22nd, 2020 Council  Meeting.  The proposed SWM design for the Madison Development has been based on the  conveyance of major and minor flows towards the existing MTO ditch, on the north side  of the Highway 407 corridor, and matches existing pre-development conditions.  Through their review process, MTO has indicated they were not supportive of a storm  outlet through their corridor and within the required 14.0 m setback. Accordingly, three  (3) alternative outlet solutions were developed and reviewed with Central Lake Ontario  Conservation Authority (CLOCA) and Town Staff and there was general consensus to  proceed with a preferred alternative which involves the least impact to the valley lands  coupled with reasonable maintenance requirements for the Town in the long term (see  Attachment No. 1, Option No. 1). Madison has additionally consulted with both CLOCA  and the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) regarding the  alternative outlet to gather input on the environmental considerations associated with  the revised design, and to discuss the required permitting. MTO has also indicated  support for the preferred alternative outlet through the valley lands.

The Anderson culvert is part of the Pringle Creek conveyance system and is located on  Anderson Street, north of Darren Avenue.  The precise age of the culvert remains  undetermined, however based on municipal records it is believed to have been  constructed circa 1985.  The 2021 Bridge and Culvert Master Study assessed the hydraulic capacity of the  culvert and determined that the culvert is not able to convey its intended 50 year design  flow (control flow). The study rated this culvert as the highest risk culvert and  recommended upsizing within the next five to ten years. (See Attachment #1 -table 9-5  and ES-1-1)  Accordingly, the improvement work is reflected in the Town's capital  planning forecast in year 2024.  There was also a question regarding the number of structures in the Town (i.e. culverts  and bridges).  Based on Town's Asset Management inventory, there are 24 bridges, 32  structural culverts and 154 cross culverts owned by the Town.      Agenda Item # 6.4 Page 73 of 209  Attachment 1:        Agenda Item # 6.4 Page 74 of 209  Memorandum to Council  Planning and Development Department  To:  Mayor and Members of Council  CC:  M. Gaskell, CAO C. Harris, Town Clerk D. Speed, Fire Chief From:  Roger Saunders, MCIP, RPP  Commissioner, Planning and Development  Date:  February 22, 2022  File #:  N/A  Subject:  850 Taunton Road East, Access Road  Acknowledged by M. Gaskell,  Chief Administrative Officer  Further to the direction by Committee of the Whole on February 14, 2022, the following  memo provides information on the existing emergency access between Taunton Road  East and Thistledown Crescent and consideration of the emergency access being  upgraded to a municipal road, as previously decided by Council in April 2019.  To assist in this regard, the April 11, 2019 memo addressing the same issues is  included herewith as Attachment #1.  At that time, a number of options were considered  to provide access to the proposed development at 850 Taunton Road East, including  the following:   Open the emergency access as a full municipal road;  Provide an easement over the existing emergency access for 850 Taunton Rd E to use as a private driveway;  Change emergency access to a full municipal road, with a cul-de-sac;  Do not allow use of the emergency access (Town right-of-way) for access to 850 Taunton Rd E;  Move the access to 850 Taunton Rd E to the west property line, to line up with Tom Edwards Drive. Agenda Item # 6.5 Page 75 of 209  Page 2 of 4    At that time, the option to open the emergency access to a full municipal road was  proposed as the preferred solution by both staff and the proponent, for the reasons  outlined in the April 2019 memo.  In particular, it was identified that the municipal road  would:   Provide the proposed development with access to the full movements signalized  intersection at Garrard Rd and Taunton Rd E;   Provide connection to Taunton Rd E for existing subdivision residents;   Proponent would be responsible for costs to upgrade to a full municipal road;  and,   Town would be responsible for snow removal and maintenance of the new road.  It is also noted that this position was not dependent upon the development to the east  (Lakeridge Heights Retirement Residence) connecting to the new municipal road.  At  the time, Lakeridge was of the opinion that they did not require such additional access  and the Town was not going to require them to connect, nor to contribute to the cost of  the new road construction.  However, should they wish to connect sometime in the  future, that option would remain open to them.   With regard to the option to provide an easement over the existing emergency  access for 850 Taunton Rd E to use as a private driveway, it was noted that:   The connection to Thistledown Cres would remain closed;   The development at 850 Taunton Rd E would be limited to right-in/right-out  access only to Taunton Rd E;   The proponent would be responsible for maintaining the emergency access,  including snow removal; and,   The restriction of access to right-in/right-out only would result in an increased  potential of U-turns, which would increase the risk of collision on Taunton Rd E.  The other three options were not considered to be viable solutions, so will not be  addressed further herein.  At the COW meeting on February 14, 2022 there was some discussion of the  emergency response times for the above access options for 850 Taunton Rd E.  In  response, WEFS has reviewed the situation and determined the following:   Fire response would be from Fire Hall 5 (111 McKinney Dr), including the Platoon  Chief Command vehicle, the Rescue truck and the Aerial truck, regardless of the  access option implemented;   Response time with the municipal road in place is 6 minutes.  The route would  entail travel along Taunton Rd eastward to Garrard Rd, turning northbound on  Agenda Item # 6.5 Page 76 of 209  Page 3 of 4    Garrard Rd to Birchpark Dr, then southbound on Thistledown Cres to 850  Taunton Rd E;   Response time without the municipal road in place is 8 minutes.  The route  would entail travel along Taunton Rd eastward to Thickson Rd, south on  Thickson to Dryden Blvd, east on Dryden to Garrard Rd, north on Garrard to  Taunton Rd, and east to the emergency access/private driveway.   Fire's response time is therefore 2 minutes longer without the municipal road in  place.  At the COW meeting of February 14, 2022 there was also discussion of other actions  that may be undertaken to address concerns of the area residents as the development  at 850 Taunton Rd E proceeds, including:  i.  Consulting with residents on the development of the construction management  plan, including preventing access to Thistledown Cres for the duration of  construction, save and except for emergency services;  ii.  Developing a traffic calming plan for the new municipal road and west leg of  Thistledown Cres, including speed humps, radar message boards and a raised  platform;  iii.  Implementing a monitoring program to obtain traffic data on speed, volumes and  other metrics, and report back in one year;  iv.  Co-ordinate with the Region to increase speed of light changes at Garrard and  Taunton; and,  v.  Review installation of a no exit sign at the entrance of Birchpark Dr at Garrard  Rd.  Certain of the above items may be undertaken in whole or in part, regardless of the  access option that is ultimately decided upon by Council, including Items i (in-part), iv  and v.    Item i, ii, iii will be addressed more fully should Council resolve to maintain the current  approval status for the existing emergency access to be upgraded to a full municipal  road standard.  However, to assist with Council's consideration of this matter at this  time, staff have prepared a preliminary plan to illustrate Potential Traffic Calming  Elements (refer to Attachment #2), including the following:   A speed hump within the new road segment, south of the proposed entrance to  the new apartment building;   A raised crosswalk at the approximate location of the existing terminus of the  emergency access;  Agenda Item # 6.5 Page 77 of 209  Page 4 of 4     Radar speed feedback signs (both ways) in the approximate mid-point of the  west leg of Thistledown Cres;   A radar data collection device on the west leg of Thistledown Cres; and,   No exit signage at the intersection of Birchpark Dr and Garrard Rd.  Finally, as was noted at the COW meeting of February 14, 2022, Site Plan Approval  was granted to 2349500 Ontario Inc. (850 Taunton Rd E) on October 30, 2019, subject  to conditions, including the following:  16.  That the proponent apply for a Road Occupancy Permit from the Engineering  Section of the Public Works Department for any work within the emergency  access right of way which will be constructed as a municipal road; and,  17. That the proponent apply for a Site Service and Access Permit from the  Engineering Section of the Public Works Department for the use of the future  municipal road to access the site for demolition and construction.  Should Council resolve to change the above conditions to no longer require the  developer to upgrade the emergency access to a municipal road standard, then the  developer of 850 Taunton Rd E will have the ability to appeal that decision to the  Ontario Land Tribunal (OLT).        Agenda Item # 6.5 Page 78 of 209  Memorandum to Council  Planning and Development Department    To:  Mayor and Members of Council  CC:  Chief Administrative Officer  Manager of Corporate Communications  Town Clerk  From:  Roger Saunders, Commissioner of  Planning and Development  Date:  April 11, 2019  File #:   DEV-13-18 (Z-24-18)  Subject:  Report PL 35-19 for 2349500 Ontario Inc.  850 Taunton Road East    Acknowledged by M. Gaskell,  Chief Administrative Officer    Further to the direction by the Committee of the Whole on April 1, 2019, the following  memo provides additional information regarding parking, the stacked parking system,  and traffic impacts.  Parking  The proposed development of 57 apartment units requires 85 parking spaces in total.  The parking rate required under Zoning By-law 1784, as amended, is 1.25 parking  spaces per apartment unit for residents (71 parking spaces required) and a rate of 0.25  per unit for visitors (14 visitor parking spaces required).   The applicant is proposing 77 parking spaces, which is deficient by 8 parking spaces.  The proposed plan is deficient 2 residential parking spaces and 6 visitor parking spaces.   The proponent's geotechnical consultant has advised that underground parking is not  feasible due to existing high water table conditions.   The proponent's Planning Rationale notes that the proposed development is able to  take advantage of the existing transit system. The proponent's Traffic Impact Study  states that the reduced parking would be adequate for the proposed development.   The Public Works Department has requested information to be submitted with the  Traffic Impact Study to justify the rationale for the reduction in parking.      Attachment #1 Agenda Item # 6.5 Page 79 of 209  Page 2 of 4    Stacked Parking System  The proponent has proposed an automated stacked parking system, identified as the  Klaus Multi-Parking Trend Vario 4200.  The manufacturer's description of the product states that the upper level of the system  moves vertically to lift the vehicles up and down, while the lower level of the system  moves the vehicles horizontally to allow the upper level vehicles to be lowered and  removed. One space on the lower level will remain empty at all times to allow the  system to shuffle vehicles in order to access the second level. Please refer to the image  below and the video links here, here and here:    The manufacturer's information states that the system includes safety features. Regular  maintenance involves visual inspections and the use of diagnostic equipment.  The proponent's Planning Rationale states that while stacked parking is new to Whitby,  it has been used in other jurisdictions including the City of Toronto.  Options for Access   Several options for access to the development have been explored by the proponent  and reviewed by the Whitby Public Works Department and the Region of Durham,  including:  • Open the Emergency Access as full municipal road to provide the proposed  development with access to the full movements signalized intersection at Garrard  Road and Taunton Road East. This option would also provide a connection to  Taunton Road for the existing subdivision residents. The proponent would be  responsible for costs to upgrade the Emergency Access to a full municipal road.  The Town would dedicate this new road as a municipal right-of-way and the  Town would be responsible for snow removal and maintenance of the new road.  This is the option recommended by the proponent and supported by Town staff.  Agenda Item # 6.5 Page 80 of 209  Page 3 of 4    It is also important to note that the need to protect the emergency access as a  full municipal roadway with access connections to Thistledown Crescent and to  Taunton Road was a condition of the adjacent approved development (All  Seniors Care) to the east of the subject site.    • Easement over Emergency Access to use the access as a private driveway.  Under this option the connection to Thistledown Crescent would remain closed  and the proposed development would be limited to right-in/right-out access only  to Taunton Road. The proponent would be responsible for maintaining the  emergency access including snow removal. This option would not require any  changes to the site design. The restriction of access to right-in/right-out only  would result in an increased potential of U-turns, which would increase the risk of  collision on Taunton Road.  The proponent would be required to construct a  sidewalk (which may be temporary) and would be responsible for full  maintenance.  The proponent would still be responsible for upgrading (at least  50%) the road (including a sidewalk) to a full municipal road in the future when  implemented.   • Change Emergency Access to a full municipal road with a cul-de-sac with  no connection to Thistledown Crescent, except to maintain the Emergency  Access connection. This option would severely impact development on this  property due to the amount of land needed to construct a cul-de-sac to  acceptable municipal standards. This option would limit the development to right- in/right-out only to Taunton, which would increase the risk of U-turns and  collisions on Taunton Road.    This option would also significantly increase Town resource requirements for  winter maintenance compared to a through connection due to the nature of a cul- de-sac and to maintain emergency access at the end of the cul-de-sac.  This  option also does not conform to the conditions that have previously been agreed  to by the Town for the provision of an ultimate roadway.  The removal of the cul- de-sac would be at the sole costs of this proponent.   • No use of Emergency Access. Under this option the proponent would need to  construct a right-in/right-out driveway access directly to Taunton Road. This  option impacts the site design by locating the building closer to the existing  houses to the north to accommodate a driveway in front of the building. This  option also increases the risk of U-turns and collisions on Taunton Road. The  direct access to Taunton Road would also increase potential conflict with the  Emergency Access should it be opened as a municipal road in future or be  required to access the approved development to the east. The proponent would  still be responsible for upgrading (at least 50%) the road to a full municipal road  in the future when implemented, should an access be required.   • Access moved to land west of the property to line up with Tom Edwards  Drive and install traffic signals. This option would involve removal/relocation of  the existing stormwater pond on the Town's property adjacent to the  development and would impact the environmentally sensitive area. The Region  Agenda Item # 6.5 Page 81 of 209  Page 4 of 4    has previously advised that traffic signals at Tom Edwards Drive does not meet  their intersection spacing requirements, but that they would consider this option.   This option is not considered practical due to the relocation requirements of a  stormwater pond.  It should be noted that as part of the approval for the development to the east (All  Seniors Care Living Centres Ltd. – 5 storey retirement home and senior's apartment  building) the Public Works Department supported the development on the condition that  if the Garrard Road access had to be restricted due to operational, maintenance or  safety concerns, that a second access to the site would be provided via a full municipal  road (such as Thistledown Crescent) or the future municipal road on the Emergency  Access.   Whitby Fire and Emergency Services has reviewed the above options and advises that  the only option that they can support is for the Emergency Access to be upgraded to a  full municipal road.  Traffic Impacts   According to the proponent's Traffic Impact Study, the estimated number of trips  expected to be generated by the 57 units are 12 trips during the a.m. peak period and  19 trips during the p.m. peak period. In addition to the proposed development, it is  expected that existing residents in the subdivision will use the new municipal road for  access to Taunton Road, when destined to the west. The daily volumes are still  expected to be low and within what would be expected for a local road. Given the area  network no shortcutting along the new municipal road (i.e. non-residents driving from  Garrard Road to Taunton Road) is anticipated.   The new municipal road would provide connectivity to the residents, and improved  safety (i.e. no U-turns).

Delegations 2.1 Billy Tung representing Madison Brooklin Developments  Limited Re: Planning and Development (Planning Services)  Department Report, PDP 10-22 Site Plan Application, Madison Brooklin, Southeast Corner  of Roybrook Avenue and Chelmsford Drive, File Number:  DEV-28-20 (SP-16-20)   Refer to Item 4.1, PDP 10-22 Billy Tung, representing Madison Brooklin Developments  Limited, advised that he and his client had read and were in  support of the Staff recommendation, and that he was  available to answer questions. A brief question and answer period ensued between  Members of Committee and Mr. Tung regarding the details  preventing the project from achieving Tier 2 of the Whitby  Green Standard. It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 4.1, PL  10-22, at this time. 2.2 George Gadanidas Re: Planning and Development (Engineering Services)  Department Report PDE 07-22 Stormwater Management Review - Dryden Culvert   Refer to Item 4.4, PDE 07-22 George Gadanidas, 3540 Anderson Street, provided a  PowerPoint presentation in response to the Stormwater  Management Review - Dryden Culvert. Highlights of the  presentation included:  the discrepancies in the information provided in the  2021 Bridge and Culvert Study versus the Study  appendix about the risk of failure of the culvert  design, and the differences between the 2006  Agenda Item # Page 85 of 209  Ministry of Transportation Design Standards versus  the 2021 Bridge and Culvert Study with respect to  design standards for culverts greater than 6 metres  and the regulatory flow for regulated water courses  such as Pringle Creek;  a request for the consultant's data and calculations  used to determine zero risk of the Dryden Boulevard  culvert failing and the refusal to share the  information;  the consultant's finding that there was no evidence of  the Dryden Culvert having any blockage issues;  the likelihood of tree limbs breaking and flowing into  the culvert during a large storm event due to the  location of the culvert being in the most densely  wooded area in Pringle Creek, a large willow tree  leaning at a 45 degree angle right at the entrance of  the culvert, and large trees lying on the ground in  proximity to the culvert;   the lack of a response to the inquiry about the effect  of Pringle Creek overtopping Dryden Boulevard, the  incorrect information provided about the probability of  one, two or all three ponds failing, and fixing damage  to Dryden Boulevard following a storm not being a  solution to a flooding problem;  the appropriate upgrade to the Dryden Culvert to a  single opening of 2.8 metres by 10 metres as noted  in the 2018 Pringle Creek Master Drainage Plan;  and,  the responsibility of the Town to upgrade the Dryden  Boulevard culvert at the same time as the Anderson  Street culvert due to the two culverts working  together. A question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Mr. Gadanidas regarding:  the locations of the ponds referenced in the  presentation;   details about the questions that were not answered  by Town Staff; and,  the amount of time spent consulting with Town Staff  during the past week. It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 4.4,  PDE 07-22, at this time. 2.3 Terry Rudkins Agenda Item # Page 86 of 209  Re: Thistledown Crescent Emergency Access Review   Refer to Item 5.2, Thistledown Crescent Emergency  Access Review Terry Rudkins, 4 Thistledown Crescent, stated that he  resides at the northwest corner of Taunton Road and  Garrard Road where the retirement home was being  constructed. He advised that he was opposed to the  proposal that the emergency access to his neighbourhood  from Taunton Road to be turned into a street or road. Mr.  Rudkins advised that he was not opposed to development  or having his neighbourhood changed in a way that would  be good for the Town, but that he was unable to find any  benefit in turning the emergency access into a road. He  stated the neighbourhood consists of a couple of crescents  with one entrance onto Garrard Road. Mr. Rudkins noted  that should the road be constructed it would only give  access to his neighbourhood to the residents of the new  apartment building, and that they would already have right- in/right-out access to and from the apartment complex via  Taunton Road with quick access to Thickson Road allowing  them to access Highway 401 or to travel north to Highway  407. He stated that access to his neighbourhood was of no  benefit to the future residents. He advised that the  neighbourhood was surrounded by conservation area that  could not be developed, that a new road would not improve  safety for the existing residents, and that the new road  would not benefit anyone else in Whitby. Mr. Rudkins  advised that his neighbourhood already has access in and  out of the neighbourhood via Garrard Road. He stated that  he and many residents in the neighbourhood contacted the  Town and inquired about whether the emergency access  would ever be turned into a road prior to purchasing their  homes and were informed that it was only designed to be  an emergency access. He advised that the residents  purchased their homes believing that they would reside in a  fairly isolated area. Mr. Rudkins stated that the new road  would dramatically change the neighbourhood that they  previously bought into. He stated that he was hopeful that  any changes in Whitby would always benefit the majority,  but that the new road would only benefit the owner of 850  Taunton Road East noting that the owner would be able to  sell or rent the condos/apartments without a problem due to  their location along a major thoroughfare. A question and answer period ensued between Members of  Agenda Item # Page 87 of 209  Committee and Mr. Rudkins regarding:  clarification about whether Town Staff or the builder  advised the residents purchasing their properties that  there would only be an emergency access and not a  road;  the circumstances that precipitated residents to  delegate at the meeting; and,  whether discussions have taken place about  measures that could be put in place to alleviate the  concerns of the community should the road be  constructed. 2.4 Paul Hoffmann Re: Thistledown Crescent Emergency Access Review   Refer to Item 5.2, Thistledown Crescent Emergency  Access Review Paul Hoffmann, 17 Thistledown Crescent, stated that he  was opposed to the proposed road connecting Taunton  Road and Thistledown Crescent and opening it to vehicular  traffic as a throughway. He advised that his property was  located on a quiet crescent where children could play  safely. Mr. Hoffmann raised concerns about the impact of  the proposed through road on the safety of children in the  area due to the increase in the number of vehicles passing  through the neighbourhood. He stated that the subdivision  has been used as a shortcut for vehicles that wish to by- pass the lengthy red light at the intersection of Taunton  Road and Garrard Road. He stated that he has repeatedly  witnessed vehicles entering the subdivision just to turn  around and travel back to Garrard Road, noting that there  was not a no exit sign posted at the entrance to the  subdivision. Mr. Hoffmann stated that the intersection of  Taunton Road and Garrard Road does not have a turning  lane southbound to travel westbound at Taunton Road and  that should one vehicle travel south on Garrard Road every  vehicle turning right on Taunton Road has to wait for the  duration of the southbound red light which occurs on a  regular basis. He advised that opening the emergency  access to right-in/right-out traffic from Taunton Road,  enables Birchpark Drive, and Thistledown Crescent to  become a convenient short cut.  Mr. Hoffman stated that the  current construction taking place at Garrard Road and  Conlin Road has already and would continue to increase  the amount of tractor trailer traffic travelling in the area. He  Agenda Item # Page 88 of 209  advised that the construction of the apartment building  adjacent to the proposed road would not only increase the  amount of traffic in the subdivision, but would result in on- street parking on the proposed road and on Thistledown  Crescent. Mr. Hoffman stated that over the past few years  residents in the area have dealt with the construction of a  six-floor retirement building right in front of their bedroom  windows. He noted that the construction workers parked  their vehicles up and down Thistledown Crescent which has  created difficulty in accessing/exiting his driveway. Mr.  Hoffman stated that parking would become an issue during  and after construction at 850 Taunton Road East. He  advised that when he purchased his property he was led to  believe that the emergency access would always be left as  such and that it was an emergency access only and was  required by Fire and Emergency Services allowing two  access points in and out of the neighbourhood in an  emergency situation only. Mr. Hoffman stated that he  disagreed with the position of Fire and Emergency Services  with respect to the emergency access road, noting that if  the neighbourhood requires two ways to enter/exit, then  every cul-de-sac in Whitby was unsafe due to being  serviced with only one entry/exit road. He requested that  Council deny the proposed road connection from Taunton  Road to Thistledown Crescent. A question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Mr. Hoffman regarding:  the source of the information that suggested the  existing emergency access road would be  maintained;  whether the delegate registered as a delegate or  signed the petition in 2019; and,  additional concerns during the construction of the  retirement home that could be included in the  construction management plan for the proposed  apartment building at 850 Taunton Road East. 2.5 Ursula Lovering Re: Thistledown Crescent Emergency Access Review   Refer to Item 5.2, Thistledown Crescent Emergency  Access Review Ursula Lovering, 19 Thistledown Crescent, stated that she  has resided on Thistledown Crescent since 2006, and that  Agenda Item # Page 89 of 209  she was an original owner. Ms. Lovering advised that she  moved into this neighbourhood because it was located near  the marsh area, and that it was a quiet and secluded  neighbourhood. She stated Thistledown Crescent was not  an avenue or street, and that opening the roadway would  completely change the essence of the neighbourhood. She  advised that she carried out due diligence when purchasing  the property and was informed by Town Staff that the  emergency access would not be turned into a road. Ms.  Lovering commented on the number of children who have  learned how to ride a bicycle on the crescent, noting that  should the emergency access be turned into a road that  children would not be able to play in front of her property.  She stated that the residents were in the neighbourhood  first and that they have already endured two to three years  of construction for the retirement home. She advised that  the neighbourhood welcomed the seniors from the  retirement home who walk through the neighbourhood,  noting that the construction of the road would also endanger  the seniors who would be threatened by the increased  traffic. She raised concerns about the increased traffic and  creation of a bottleneck of traffic at Taunton Road and  Garrard Road. A question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Ms. Lovering regarding;  confirmation that the delegate's property was  purchased through the builder; and,  whether there was any indication upon purchasing  the property that the emergency access would  change. 2.6 Terence Hopman Re: Thistledown Crescent Emergency Access Review   Refer to Item 5.2, Thistledown Crescent Emergency  Access Review When called upon, Mr. Hopman was not in attendance to  make a delegation to the Committee. 2.7 Fadi Eid Re: Thistledown Crescent Emergency Access Review Refer to Item 5.2, Thistledown Crescent Emergency  Access Review Agenda Item # Page 90 of 209  Fadi Eid, 15 Thistledown Crescent, stated that he was a  builder and that he had inquired with Town Staff about the  area prior to moving in November 2019. Mr. Eid advised  that he had contacted Town Staff a few weeks ago and was  informed about approval to open the road and that it would  no longer be an emergency access only. He raised  concerns about the safety of his children as a result of the  additional traffic and on-street parking in the neighbourhood  by construction workers and visitors pre and post  construction at 850 Taunton Road East. He raised concerns  about the nearby pond noting that the owner plans to  increase the size of his land by draining the pond through  the removal of underground water and purchase the land to  expand the project. Mr. Eid raised further concerns about  damage to the structure of the houses in the neighbourhood  from vibration that would be created from the construction of  the underground parking and building foundation. A question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Mr. Eid regarding:  confirmation about when the delegate moved into his  residence and when the delegate was informed  about the approval of the emergency access road;  and,  clarification on the delegate's comment about the  owner of 850 Taunton Road East increasing the size  of his land. 2.8 Rodger Miller representing 2349500 Ontario Inc. Re: Thistledown Crescent Emergency Access Review Refer to Item 5.2, Thistledown Crescent Emergency  Access Review Rodger Miller, representing 2349500 Ontario Inc., stated  that he was representing the owner of 850 Taunton Road  East. Mr. Miller referenced correspondence dated and  submitted on February 14, 2022 regarding the owner's  concerns about reconsidering the road connection matter.  Mr. Miller advised that his client has spent considerable  time and resources moving forward with the Site Plan  approval process for this development, that they were in the  final weeks of completing the process, and that he was  hoping to have Site Plan approval in March 2022. He further  advised that his client was concerned that the matter was  being reopened at this time after it was fully reviewed and  Agenda Item # Page 91 of 209  vetted during the public process in 2019. Mr. Miller noted  the dates of the Public Meeting, the Committee of Whole  meeting to consider the Staff recommendation report, and  Council meeting wherein the Staff report was approved by  Council. He advised that during the April meetings Town  Staff responded to a number of questions about the future  access from Taunton Road to Thistledown Crescent, noting  Staff concerns about potential U-turns at Taunton Road as  a result of the restricted right-in/right-out access for 850  Taunton Road East. He advised of discussion about the  extension of medians on Taunton Road and the fear that  there would be a right-in/right-out at the intersections of  Taunton Road and Garrard Road and Taunton Road and  Tom Edwards Drive. Mr. Miller stated that Staff raised  further concerns about the effectiveness of the current  access giving the inability to provide snowplowing on the  connection due to it being chained off. He noted that a full  municipal road connection was the preferred option for Fire  and Emergency Services. Mr. Miller stated that his client  believes that a full road connection would be the best  solution for the local neighbourhood and the development.  He noted that any traffic from the residential apartment  development was expected to have a negligible impact on  the existing neighbourhood to the north and that it would  also afford an alternative access and emergency services  access to the homes located there. Mr. Miller advised that  his client feels that if the full municipal road connection was  deferred now only to be required at a later date, the road  construction would create significant management and  logistical issues for the future tenants of the apartment  building and the existing community. He stated that his  client has agreed to accept the financial obligation for  implementing a full road concurrent with the construction of  their building. Mr. Miller advised that his client was  requesting that the Committee not reopen the access matter  as removing a future full road connection to the north would  not be in the best interests of the community. In response to  some of the concerns raised by delegates Mr. Miller advised  that retaining the trees along the north limit of the property  was part of the development proposal and that they have  been retained. He noted that those conifer trees were  intended to provide a visual screen to the future  construction of the apartment building. Mr. Miller advised  that the remaining trees were impacted by the footprint of  the development and that this was part of the presentation  to Council in April 2019.

Delegations 7.1 Martin Field Re: Legal and Enforcement Services Department Report,  LS 02-22 Amendments to Responsible Pet Ownership By-law # 7294- 17 to Regulate the Sourcing of Domestic Animals Available  for Sale    Refer to Item 9.5, LS 02-22 Martin Field, 1134 Somerville Street, Oshawa, advised that  he has been advocating for an amendment to the  Responsible Pet Ownership By-law regarding the sourcing  of domestic animals for sale at pet shops for about four  years. Mr. Field advised that he was in support of the Staff  report, noting that the report addresses both animal welfare  provisions and consumer protection to constituents within  the Town of Whitby. He requested that the recommendation  contained within the Staff report be approved. 7.2 Val McIntrye Re: Legal and Enforcement Services Department Report,  LS 02-22 Amendments to Responsible Pet Ownership By-law # 7294- 17 to Regulate the Sourcing of Domestic Animals Available  for Sale    Refer to Item 9.5, LS 02-22 Val McIntrye, 141 Carnwith Drive East, advised that pet  stores were one of the two primary outlets for puppy mill  Agenda Item # Page 112 of 209  puppies with the other outlet being the internet. Ms.  McIntrye stated that the fear of not having a by-law in place  to prohibit commercial activity was that it would leave the  door open for this inhumane practice. Ms. McIntrye  encouraged Whitby to follow municipalities like Oakville,  Vaughan, Toronto, and Cambridge who have already  banned the practice and to join Oshawa and Newmarket  who have taken steps toward banning domestic pet sales  from pet shops. She stated that when communities close  the door to pet sales from pet shops the puppy mill owners  lose income incentive to engage in this practice, and that  more animals would be adopted into forever homes from  reputable shelters. She stated that society would look at  dogs, cats, and bunnies as part of their families and not as  commodities. It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 9.5, LS  02-22, at this time. 7.3 Astrid Poei Re: Fire and Operational Services Department (Operational  Services) Report, FOS(OS) 01-22 Debrief Report Winter Snow Storm 2022   Refer to Item 9.4, FOS(OS) 01-22 Astrid Poei, 68 Westfield Drive, stated that she was glad to  see a winter maintenance report with suggestions for  improvement, but that Staff could go a lot further to ensure  Whitby residents were protected. Ms. Poei commented on  the heavy snowfall event that took place on January 17,  2022. She advised that she understood that there were  different standards for tertiary roads versus primary roads  and that primary roads were a priority. She stated that her  neighbours had called about snowplowing efforts several  times between January 17 and 18, 2022 using appropriate  channels provided on the Town's website, and that on  January 19 Members of Council inquired via social media  about roads that had not yet been plowed. Ms. Poei advised  that she had identified Westfield Drive, Bluegill Crescent,  Coho Drive, Sauger Lane and Whitefish Street and the area  north of Bonacord Avenue as areas that had not being  plowed at that time. Ms. Poei stated that the response she  received was that the areas identified were the  responsibility of the developer and not the responsibility of  the Town. She commented on the area being described as  Agenda Item # Page 113 of 209  not being paved, that there were raised manholes, and  incomplete curbs. Ms. Poei indicated that the area has  curbs and that the asphalt was flush with the manholes. She  stated that the Town's website link ""Find My Street""  provides information about the areas of Whitby maintained  by the Town throughout the winter, noting that Westfield  Drive, Bluegill Crescent, Coho Drive, Sauger Lane and  Whitefish Street were all listed as roads maintained by the  Town. She advised that after further inquiries she was  informed that the area of Queen's Common West was  confirmed as being the Town's responsibility. Ms. Poei  stated that residents rely on Town Staff as subject matter  experts and to provide accurate information. She noted that  the roads in Queen's Common West were not plowed/salted  even after subsequent snowfalls following the storm on  January 17, 2022. She requested that the Staff report  include strategies for bridging the gap between engineering,  development, and internal communication protocols and  operations. She further requested that the Town require that  the developer submit a snow plow plan with acceptable  service standards along with a Letter of Credit (LOC), and  that should the developer fail to meet those service  standards that the Town immediately execute the LOC in  order to ensure that emergency services can access  residents in the area. Ms. Poei suggested that the Town  consider rotating the circuits for tertiary roads so that  residents residing the furthest away from the Operations  Centre experience quicker snow clearing. She stated that  she understood that there was a plan to improve  communications, but that she hoped it was not just a  technological solution being sought. She commented that  customer service was responding in a way that meets the  expectations of residents. Ms. Poei stated that the Town  was responsible for the well-being of its residents and  should consider adopting a ""making the connection"" service  standard whereby a resident seeking assistance would be  helped by way of Town Staff making the appropriate  connection as opposed to the resident. She inquired about  whether the Town considered staggering staff shifts to avoid  the 14-hour deployment time issue, whether snow plow  operators sleep at the yard, the travel time for the snow  plow operators to reach the yard, exploring outsourcing  snow clearing operations with Staff oversight, and  connecting areas where there was an overlap between the  Region and Town responsibilities that require attention. Agenda Item # Page 114 of 209  Recommendation: Moved By Councillor Newman That Committee suspend the rules of procedure in order to  hear a delegation from Janice Campbell with respect to Item  9.4, FOS(OS) 01-22.  Carried on a Two Thirds Vote 7.4 Janice Campbell Re: Fire and Operational Services Department (Operational  Services) Report, FOS(OS) 01-22 Debrief Report Winter Snow Storm 2022 Refer to Item 9.4, FOS(OS) 01-22 Janice Campbell, 8 Closson Drive, stated that she was in  agreement with the comments made by the previous  delegate regarding the snowplowing/salting services  received between January 17, to 18, 2022. Ms. Campbell  advised that she resided north of the area that the previous  delegate had spoken about. She raised concerns about the  winter snow storm maintenance operations specifically  related to the resulting safety concerns of residents in the  area. Ms. Campbell raised concerns about residents who  had sustained injuries from a slip and fall due to the lack of  snowplowing/salting. She raised further concerns about the  lack of parking alternatives and the inability for emergency  services to access residents in the community due to the  narrowing of the street and lack of snowplowing/salting,  noting that one resident was in the process of giving birth,  and a child had a severe allergic reaction. Ms. Campbell  inquired about how the safety and access concerns raised  would be addressed. It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item  9.4,  FOS(OS) 01-22, at this time. 7.5 Michael Tranquada and John Kiemele Re: Legal and Enforcement Services Department Report,  LS 04-22 Amendments to Property Standards By-law # 6874-14,  Hedge Heights and Management of Vermin Agenda Item # Page 115 of 209    Refer to Item 9.7, LS 04-22 Michael Tranquada and John Kiemele, 31 Montana  Crescent, stated that they were opposed to the Staff  recommendation. Mr. Kiemele requested that Council  consider the benefits and importance of preserving or  modifying the by-law to maintain an acceptable property  standard for hedge heights in the community. He advised  that he and his husband moved into an established low-rise  residential area in Brooklin in 2010 that had an existing  cedar hedge along their rear property line which extended  partially along two of his neighbour's lots and totalled 80  feet in width. Mr. Kiemele advised that at that time his home  was a newly constructed bungalow and that the home  located to the rear of his property abutting Way Street was  part of an older neighbourhood where there were several  wide lots with well established cedar hedges and mature  trees with open views to Lynde Creek. He stated that the  hedges and mature vegetation were some of the landscape  features that he and his husband appreciated as they  provided privacy for their property. He noted that at that  time he moved into his home the hedge was within the  required height measuring approximately three metres in  height, and that it was manageable for maintenance by the  property owner or a landscape service company. Mr.  Kiemele stated that over the past twelve years he has dealt  with two property owners regarding the maintenance of the  hedge resulting in him covering half of the cost for cutting  the hedge height along the rear property line. He noted that  several years passed between trimmings due to the  unwillingness of his neighbour to pay for the hedge  maintenance which resulted in several feet of new growth  each year. Mr. Kiemele stated that his neighbour was  unwilling to reduce the height of the hedge by more than a  modest trim due to the additional cost which has resulted in  the hedge height that currently exceeds 26 feet. He noted  that the height of the hedge has made it impossible to trim  without the use of scaffolding and special equipment which  would result in a significant increase in the cost of  maintenance. Mr. Kiemele commented on his frustration  watching this occur while other hedges along Way Street  have been well maintained and remain closer to the by-law  height restriction. He stated that the increased hedge height  has caused excessive shading in his yard, that it has  damaged many of his plantings, that it has significantly  reduced the visibility of the skyline, and that the view of  Agenda Item # Page 116 of 209  Lynde Creek has been eliminated. Mr. Kiemele advised that  the existing by-law was his only recourse to force his  neighbour to comply with the legal responsibility of  maintaining the hedge. He stated that he filed a complaint  with Legal and Enforcement Services last fall which was  currently under appeal by his neighbour, noting that the  decision was on hold until the outcome the Staff report. Mr.  Kiemele stated that the current by-law was reasonable and  sufficient to assist in ensuring property maintenance and to  preserve acceptable conditions for an urban and suburban  neighbourhood. He advised that he understood that there  may be some challenges for enforcement of the by-law with  the current hedge height restriction limited to a maximum  height of 3 metres due to damage that may be caused to  mature vegetation. Mr. Kiemele stated that he felt that it was  important that the Town have a by-law to prevent excessive  hedge growth and to offer some form of recourse for  residents in this situation. He suggested that it might be  more appropriate to rewrite the by-law to preserve an ideal  hedge height of 3 metres in order to maintain visibility and  sightlines, and that mature hedges be reduced in height as  much as possible to be compliant with the 3-metre  maximum height to a point that it will not cause permanent  damage to the hedge as may be determined by an arborist.  Mr. Kiemele stated that many other municipalities have  hedge height restrictions which were captured under fence  by-laws including hedges along property lines as part of  their fence definition. He cited the definition of fence in  Ajax's Fence By-law, noting that by including hedges as  part of the fence by-law greater restrictions to hedge heights  were imposed by limiting them to 2 metres in height. He  stated that Whitby's current by-law allows for greater  flexibility. Mr. Kiemele noted that in his capacity as an  architect and urban designer that he must stress the  incompatibility of allowing excessive hedge heights in urban  and suburban neighbourhoods, noting that his current  situation demonstrates how this was problematic for the  community. He compared the 26-foot high hedge to a large  3-storey wall or fence of the same height and magnitude  along a property line, noting that this was not currently  permitted in low-rise residential neighbourhoods. Mr.  Kiemele raised concerns about allowing hedges to grow as  high as the hedge abutting his property line, noting that it  creates issues including excessive shading and blocking of  direct sunlight, invasive roots, damage to ground cover,  grass and other plantings, the loss of natural sightlines,  Agenda Item # Page 117 of 209  creating a habitat for pests that cause property damage, the  prohibitive maintenance costs that necessitate equipment  such as scaffolding or a scissor lift to reach the top of the  hedge, and the negative impact on property value. Mr.  Kiemele encouraged Members of Committee to view the  hedge abutting his property as evidence as to why the Town  needs to retain the existing by-law. A brief question and answer period ensued between  Members of Committee, Mr. Tranquada, and Mr. Kiemele  regarding confirmation that the delegate had assisted in  maintaining the hedge for a number of years, but that it was  currently an unkempt hedge that blocks the sunlight and  view of the creek. 7.6 Jennifer Loach-Perry Re: Legal and Enforcement Services Department Report,  LS 04-22 Amendments to Property Standards By-law # 6874-14,  Hedge Heights and Management of Vermin Refer to Item 9.7, LS 04-22 Jennifer Loach-Perry, 118 Way Street, advised that she has  been the owner of her property since 1971. She stated that  she has a line of cedar trees along the property line along  the rear and side yard, that her cedar trees have been  around a long time, and that the trees were beautiful and  historical. Ms. Loach-Perry stated that the houses located  behind her property were constructed about 35 years after  her home was built. She advised that the cedar trees  provide privacy and were good for the environment, noting  that cutting down the trees would disturb the balance of  nature and the habitat of animals/wildlife. Ms. Loach-Perry  stated that she could understand the concerns if the cedar  trees impeded a sightline, noting that her trees did not  impede a sightline. She advised that the cedar trees were  serviced/cut back/de-vined in 2019, and that due to the  pandemic in 2020 she was unable to have the trees  serviced. Ms. Loach-Perry advised that in 2021 she  arranged for a company to come and cut back/de-vine the  cedar trees, but that the company had backed out at the last  minute. She stated that should the cedar trees be reduced  to a height of 3 metres, as per the current by-law, that it  would kill the trees. She advised that certified arborists have  come to look at the cedar trees and informed her that  Agenda Item # Page 118 of 209  significant reductions in height would cause the trees to fail  and eventually die. She commented on wasting taxpayers  dollars by sending out By-law Enforcement Officers to  determine whether a hedge meets the 3-metre height. Ms.  Loach-Perry inquired about the definition of a hedge versus  a tree, noting that arborists have informed her that her  cedars were trees, that they did not want to be responsible  for cutting them back due to the damage it would cause,  and that they could not believe that she was told to butcher  the trees. She stated that Pickering and Clarington do not  have height restrictions and that the requirement of Ajax  and Oshawa was that there be a break within the rows of  cedar trees. Ms. Loach-Perry stated that she understood  that the Property Standards Appeal Committee had issued  a number of 5-year extensions to Orders to provide a  window of time for owners to gradually reduce hedge  heights, but that she was only given 7 months to bring the  cedar trees to the 3-metre height. She noted that cedars  were the only visual and sound barrier between a  homeowner and their neighbour, that they offer value to the  property and that they were invaluable to homeowners. She  stated that she understood the importance of maintaining  and de-vining the cedars so as not to harm the trees. Ms.  Loach-Perry commented on other properties in the  neighbourhood that have hedges that exceed the hedge  height requirements. She stated that it was important to  amend the current Property Standards By-law to remove  the maximum hedge heights in side and rear yards. Ms.  Loach-Perry advised that the Town's by-law refers to a  hedge as a line of three or more closely planted bushes or  shrubs planted in a manner that creates a significant barrier  to light without the existence of large gaps, but shall not  include living walls identified by the Town as acoustic  barriers, noting that cedar trees should not fall under the by- law because of their height and width potential. A question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Ms. Loach-Perry regarding:  confirmation that the arborist determined that the  cedars on the delegate's property were trees and not  a hedge; and,  the number of cedar trees located on the property  and/or in the rear yard. It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 9.7, LS  04-22, at this time. Agenda Item # Page 119 of 209  8. Correspondence 8.1 There was no correspondence. 9.

Gaskell, Chief  Administrative Officer  For additional information, contact:  Sharon Meredith, Senior Manager,  Recreation, 905.444.1808  Sarah Lamb-Kirby, Supervisor,  Recreation Client Services,  905.444.1851  Sean Malby, Supervisor,   Parks Development, 905.444.1851  1. Recommendation: That Council approve Brooklin Memorial Park as the location for the  development of one temporary cricket field (Attachment 1);  That Council approve a new 2022 capital project in the amount of  $52,000 for the establishment and construction of one temporary cricket  field at Brooklin Memorial Park. To be funded from the Growth Capital  Reserve Fund;  That cricket be considered in the research and development of the 2022  Parks and Recreation Master Plan; and,  That staff be directed to develop a strategy for the creation of cricket  facilities as guided by the Parks and Recreation Master Plan.  Agenda Item # 9.1 Page 130 of 209  Report CMS 04-22  Council  Page 2 of 7  2. Highlights: • Cricket has been identified as a new and emerging sport in Whitby with increasing demand for cricket fields. • In the fall of 2021 Council directed staff to explore opportunities to create a temporary cricket field within existing Town owned facilities. • A review of field sizes and locations has identified that Brooklin Memorial Park is of a suitable size to develop a cricket field and these modifications could be undertaken without negatively impacting existing field users. • Costs to undertake the necessary field modifications have been identified as $52,000. 3. Background: Cricket has been identified as an emerging sport in the Durham Region. Community Services staff has worked with Whitby Cricket to permit multiuse  fields for temporary cricket pitches since the 2020 season, and have received  requests from other cricket organizations for permitted space.  In the 2015 Sports Facility Strategy, the consultants recognized that a number of  G.T.A. municipalities had or were in the process of positioning themselves to  respond to field sport needs of diverse cultural communities. Cricket pitches are  the most notable example with communities such as Mississauga, Ajax, and  Brampton having already developed facilities for such purposes. Increasingly, a  service level target of one cricket pitch per 100,000 population was becoming  common in sports field planning at the time. The recommendation in the strategy  was to construct one new multi-use field (artificial or natural turf surface to be  determined), potentially in partnership with a local school board. Contingent upon  achieving a successful operating profile for this field, a second multi-use field  may be developed if warranted by future needs.  The first request for a space to play cricket came in January 2020. Due to  Covid-19 restrictions the 2020 season was much shorter than expected running  from September to October 2020 with practices only. Permits were issued for  Country Lane ball diamond for cricket play.   Play expanded and for the 2021 season after Covid-19 restrictions lifted Whitby  Cricket began their season at Baycliffe Park soccer field in July. The amount of  time required grew significantly from 2020 to 2021 and the amount of permitted  time for cricket play on weekends expanded to accommodate that growth. The  increase in play resulted in a variety of complaints from the Baycliffe community.  On August 28, 2021 Whitby Cricket was relocated to Gordon Street fields. This  location allowed for increased play with room for three cricket pitches, as well as  parking for participants and spectators. The Gordon Street Field was created in  2008 to accommodate a request for outdoor field space by the minor Lacrosse  Agenda Item # 9.1 Page 131 of 209  Report CMS 04-22  Council  Page 3 of 7  Lady Blue Knights. The Lady Blue Knights use the field for 10 hours per week  from May to end of July. Once the Lady Blue Knights season concluded their  2021 season the space was available for cricket to permit for the remainder of  the season.  At the September 20, 2021 Committee of the Whole meeting, a motion regarding  a temporary cricket field and future cricket amenities in the Town was introduced.  Subsequently, at the regular Council Meeting held on October 4, 2021, Ryan  Turnbull, MP, Whitby appeared before Council and stated that he met with  members of the community during the Federal election campaign who were  playing cricket at Baycliffe Park. MP Turnbull indicated his support for the  recommendation and noted the importance of permanent cricket pitches in the  future. MP Turnbull stated that the Town is known as an inclusive community and  that opportunities for sport should reflect that inclusivity. He advised that there  are over 250 players in the Whitby Cricket Club and suggested forming a  reference group from their membership to give advice to the Town on the  development of cricket pitches and growing the sport in the community.  During the Regular Council Meeting October 4, 2021, in support of the  delegation, Council passed Resolution # 246-21:  ""Whereas the Town of Whitby is in a period of significant growth; and,  Whereas that growth is changing the community interest and desire for new  recreational amenities and opportunities; and,  Whereas a number of community members continue to express interest in the  opportunity to play cricket; and  Whereas the Town of Whitby does not currently have cricket facilities;  Now Therefore be it Resolved:  1. That Staff explore opportunities to create a temporary cricket field within existing Town owned facilities, and update Council by year end on next steps; and, 2. That the Parks and Recreation Master Plan, to begin in late 2021 and be completed in 2022, be informed in part by the use of the temporary cricket field in order to determine future needs for cricket fields in the Town; and, 3. That, in conjunction with the development of the Parks and Recreation Master Plan, Staff be directed to explore opportunities to add cricket amenities at the Whitby Sports Complex."" 4. Discussion: Agenda Item # 9.1 Page 132 of 209  Report CMS 04-22  Council  Page 4 of 7  Staff reviewed options for the temporary location for cricket for the 2022 season  and beyond. Gordon Street fields, Consumers fields, and Jeffery Park were  explored as options for the future temporary site for Cricket. Gordon Street Fields  has been permitted to Lady Blue Knights Lacrosse since 2008. Staff met with Lady  Blue Knights Lacrosse to explore an alternate location for Lacrosse but the  organization had many concerns about moving to a new location. As a result of the  concerns raised by the Lady Blue Knights, Gordon Street Field was eliminated as  an option.  Staff met with representatives of Whitby Cricket to review the remaining options.  Consumers Fields and Jeffery Park were also proposed as options but ruled out  by the Cricket organizations due to size concerns. As a result of the size of the  space required and in consultation with Parks Operations, Parks Planning, and the  Recreation Client Services, Brooklin Memorial Park was identified as the preferred  site for a temporary Cricket field in Whitby (Attachment 1).  Representatives from Whitby Cricket, have participated in staff research and  planning sessions to consult on needs for the space from the perspective of the  local cricket community. Parks planning staff have researched and connected with  surrounding municipalities on best practices for the formation and maintenance of  cricket pitches.  Staff have also consulted with the President of the Brooklin Spring Fair, Brooklin  Agricultural Society to discuss possible field amendments and to mitigate any  issues with the shared use of space understanding the historical significance of  the location to the Brooklin Agricultural Society.  While Brooklin Memorial Park offers a good temporary home for cricket, it is  important to note that this site as a multi-purpose property will never become a  premiere level sports field. There is a master plan exercise for the future  development of Brooklin Memorial Park and Luther Vipond Memorial Arena which  is recognized as an important Town Park.   While staff have received inquiries from multiple parties interested in space for  cricket, only one group, Whitby Cricket, followed through to the issuance of a  permit.  It is anticipated that the Town may receive requests from other Cricket  organizations once cricket fields are developed.  Staff are in the process of  developing a Field Allocation Policy that would include cricket fields and identify  how organizations/requests will be prioritized. In the absence of a policy, requests  would consider the availability of requested time, and would give priority to existing  field type users.  Historically the Brooklin Memorial Park field has not been operated or maintained  as a sports field and therefore significant work is required to prepare the area for  play. These improvements include work on the playing surface and turf grass to  lessen the rough and uneven characteristics of this property. Additional  improvements to the field would include the installation of one artificial cricket pitch  Agenda Item # 9.1 Page 133 of 209  Report CMS 04-22  Council  Page 5 of 7  matt and a precast concrete storage unit for maintenance equipment and matt  storage during the winter.   This renovation work involves heavy mechanical rolling, that would be completed  in the spring of 2022. Parks Operations would also employ aeration, over-seeding,  fertilization and cutting programs to improve the turf quality.   It is expected that there will be annual incremental cost for Parks Operations of  $10,000.00, to provide increased maintenance and waste receptacles excluding  staffing.  It is anticipated that the above work will be completed and the field would be  available for cricket to commence play between June 20 and July 4, 2022  dependent on weather and field conditions. Staff are currently reviewing options  that would allow Whitby Cricket to begin their season in May until the Brooklin  Memorial field is available at another park location.    5. Financial Considerations: The total capital cost to establish the proposed temporary cricket field at Brooklin Memorial Park through the refurbishment and modification of the existing fields is estimated at $52,000 and is detailed in Table 1 below. Table 1: Brooklin Memorial Park Cricket Field  Capital Costs  (Inclusive of applicable taxes)  Item  Cost  Earthworks, Excavations and Field Rolling  $14,000  Precast Concrete Storage Unit  $12,000  Cricket Pitch Construction  $17,000  Mobilization and Construction Testing  $4,000  Sub-total  $47,000  Contingency  $5,000  Total Capital Cost (Budget Request)  $52,000  Agenda Item # 9.1 Page 134 of 209  Report CMS 04-22  Council  Page 6 of 7  It is recommended that a new capital project for the construction of the cricket field  be established in 2022 for $52,000 funded from the Growth Capital Reserve Fund.  Park Operations anticipates that there will be an incremental annual operating cost  of $10,000 to provide increased maintenance to the park/cricket pitches and waste  receptacles. This cost will be partially offset by projected incremental revenue of  $6,700 related to the permitting.  The balance of 2022 costs will be offset by other  2022 budget savings.  Staff will review the actual costs and revenues after the 2022  season to determine budget pressures, if any, for the 2023 budget related to the  provision of cricket pitches at Brooklin Memorial Park.  6. Communication and Public Engagement: Community Services staff have engaged Whitby Cricket in discussions regarding the suitability of the Brooklin Memorial Park location as well as field design to ensure proposed field will meet the needs of the organization and cricket players in general.  Staff have also met with the President of Brooklin Spring Fair to discuss possible field amendments and to mitigate any issues relating to shared use of the park. 7. Input from Departments/Sources: Parks Operations recognize the importance of working together to find a suitable temporary home for cricket in Whitby until a permanent location can be secured and developed. In anticipation of the Brooklin Memorial site becoming the new temporary home for cricket, Parks Operations completed an initial round of turf aeration in November 2021. In 2022 and moving forward, additional incremental maintenance to this field will include:  twice yearly aeration and fertilization; increased frequency of mowing from once every 16 days to once weekly (minimum); annual top- dressing and/or over seeding and/or sod repairs; field and turf repair each June following the Brooklin Spring Fair; increased placement of garbage receptacles and increased frequency of litter and debris collection. Please note that due to the shared usage of this field with the Brooklin Spring Fair, additional resources will be required annually, over and above those normally required for a typical sports field, to maintain the field in a playable condition. It is anticipated that the field damage created annually by the heavy equipment at the Brooklin Spring Fair, will require that the cricket grounds are closed for up to two weeks after the fair to insure safe and suitable playing conditions. 8.

Gaskell,  Chief Administrative Officer    The purpose of this memorandum is to provide background information related to By- law 7868-22, a by-law to authorize Staff to enter into a Transfer Payment Agreement  with the Province of Ontario related to the Streamline Development Fund grant.  At the Ontario Housing Affordability Summit on January 19, 2022, the Province of  Ontario announced a new $45 million Streamline Development Approval Fund. The  fund is intended to help Ontario's 39 largest municipalities to modernize, streamline and  accelerate processes for managing and approving housing applications.  All of this ""to  get shovels in the ground faster and unlock the supply of housing"" per the letter from the  Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing.  The Town of Whitby's work plans already included projects related to the modernization  and streamlining of the development application process so the Town confirmed interest  in accessing this grant funding.  On February 7, 2022, the Town was provided a Transfer Payment Agreement (the  ""TPA"") related to a $1 million Streamline Development Fund grant for the Town of  Whitby.  The deadline to sign and send the TPA back to the Province was March 1,  2022.  Given that March 7, 2022 is the first regularly scheduled Council meeting  Agenda Item # 10.10 Page 208 of 209  Page 2 of 2    following receipt of the TPA, there is a by-law on the March 7, 2022 Council agenda  authorizing Staff to enter into the TPA with an effective date of March 1, 2022.  In accordance with the requirements of the TPA, the Town will submit an interim report  to the Province by April 22, 2022 which will include a written description outlining how  the Town intends to spend the grant funds, a workplan, timeline and budget for the  project.  The Town will be working through these details and will provide Council with a  future memo outlining the plan prior to submitting the interim report to the Province.

S. Cassel, Deputy Clerk, provided the purposes and guidelines of the  public meeting to members of the audience.  The Chair noted that a number of pieces of correspondence had been  received and distributed to Members of Council prior to the meeting in  regard to this matter.  Ed Belsey, Manger, Long Range Planning and Susan McGregor,  Principal Planner, appeared before Council and provided a PowerPoint  presentation summarizing the changes and highlights of the Draft  Recommended Amendment for the Town's Official Plan Review.  The Chair opened the floor for comments from the public.  Matthew Cory from Malone Given Parsons Ltd, appeared before Council  on behalf of the Brooklin Land Owners Group and stated that there  comments were technical in nature and that they would be submitting a  written submission in this regard.  He advised that he was at the original  Official Plan Review meetings and hopes to see the Brooklin Secondary  Plan come forward soon. He commented on the Brooklin Bypass and  noted that although the route had not yet been  selected, that it was  important to acknowledge it in the Plan.  Jim McGrory, 18 Kimberly Drive, Brooklin, appeared before Council and  stated that he was hoping to see more information regarding source  water protection. Mr. McGrory further stated that he was hoping the  Transportation amendment would move towards supporting an active  and safe transportation theme. He advised that active transportation is  healthy transportation and would like to see more small local green  spaces that are within walking distances for communities. Mr. McGrory  stated that green spaces should be a part of the overall Plan noting that   once the space has been used up the opportunities will be lost and it  cannot be gained back  Lisa Bulford, 114 Crystal Beach Boulevard, Whitby, appeared before  Council and stated that she lives in an amazing community along the  shoreline of Lake Ontario but that it is not recognized for its value in the  community through the Official Plan and respective land uses. She  noted that residential land use is not recognized for the area and that  this needs to be brought to the Town's attention as it affects land values.  She advised that she submitted comments through the public process at  a previous meeting and was disappointed in how the Town has  addressed her comments in advising that a majority of the lands are  designated as Hazard Lands. Ms. Bulford advised she has been in  Page 2 of 5  Special Council Minutes   January 31, 2017 - 7:00 PM    contact with the Conservation Authority and was advised that they can  get a permit to demolish and rebuild on the lands, however the zoning  provisions in place would require her to obtain a minor variance in order  to make modifications to her property.   John Armstrong, 8991 St. Paul Street, Street, Catharines, appeared  before Council on behalf of Masonry Works to congratulate the Town on  putting forward a strong draft Plan that contained strong language  supporting urban design and climate change. Mr. Armstrong suggested  that the Official Plan include more site plan control for linked residential,  duplexes, and single family homes as provided for under the Planning  Act and apply site plan control to smaller residential developments. He  further advised that the Official Plan should not only be focused on the  front facade of houses but that building material should be carried all the  way around dwellings so as to avoid the Hollywood Set Effect. Mr.  Armstrong stated the he encouraged best practice principles used in the  Official Plan to also be applied to the Urban Design Manual and to give  more notice to the key entry points that are gateways in and out of  Whitby.  Chris Jones, Director of Planning Regulation, Central Lake Ontario  Conservation Authority (CLOCA), 100 Whiting Avenue, Oshawa,  appeared before Council to congratulate Town Staff in working  cooperatively with CLOCA to achieve the amendments presented in the  Plan.  Mr. Jones stated that the key item they asked for in their  comments was vegetation protection zones or buffers to woodlands and  wetlands. He further stated that previously these were established  through environmental assessment impacts but the proposed  amendment by the Town looks to include fixed protection zones to  provide some certainty of protection. Mr. Jones advised that the  language used in the Official Plan in relation to climate change will help  to add more vegetative areas and mitigate temperature changes in  Town streams. He further advised that CLOCA was grateful to be a  partner in this Official Plan process and provide input into the  environmental components being presented.  Richard Klingler, 4945 Garden Street, Whitby, appeared before Council  regarding his property, otherwise known as Lot 24, Concession 4. Mr.  Klingler stated that for many years the Town was allowed to burn  garbage on the land adjacent to his property. He further stated that after  1960, garbage was buried instead of burned so now that land is a  garbage dump site with no liner. Mr. Klingler stated that he has been  approached by the Town several times regarding his property because  he is the only private owner that abuts the former dump site. He advised  that the Town has encroached on his property and dug past the property  line causing an erosion issue on the embankment. He further advised  Page 3 of 5  Special Council Minutes   January 31, 2017 - 7:00 PM    leachate also goes into his property due an easement that the Town put  through in 1974. Mr. Klingler stated that he has received four proposals  for putting a leachate pond up against his property and that the Town  was going to repair the right-of-way. He inquired about the extension of  Garden Street and the location for the extension noting that if the dump  was disturbed it would open up several issues.  He requested that he be  given answers to address his concerns.   There were no further submissions from the public.

Highlights of  the presentation included:  • water issues along the foundation and excavation required to  remedy those issues;  • the current condition of the porch feature;  • plans for the new structure that could withstand the current  loadbearing issues such as snow accumulation over the columns;  and,  • efforts to maintain the original detailing and appearance of the  reconstructed porch.

Re: 72 Baldwin Street (Part V) - Proposed Ground Sign     Having previously declared a conflict of interest, Lynn Collins did not  take part in the discussion or voting of this matter.  Stacey Kursikowski provided an overview of the application for a ground  sign for a new commercial development located at 72 Baldwin Street.  Ms. Kuriskowski advised that the building was located in the Brooklin  Conservation District and was a Part V designated property. She stated  that the developer and sign consultants were seeking approval for a  ground sign. She further stated that the application met the provisions of  the Town's Permanent Sign By-law 7379-18 and that the Committee's  role was to consider sign plans in relation to the character of the  heritage streetscape and the guildelines of the heritage district. Finally,  Ms. Kursikowsi stated that the Ministry of Transportation Ontario (MTO)  required the sign platform to comply with a three (3) metre setback from  the road.   Anthony Campoli and Frank Perri provided a presentation for the  proposed ground sign. Highlights of the presentation included:  • positioning of the sign outwards towards Baldwin Street to  provide clear view of the buildings;   • constructing the sign to match elements from the building;  • using weather resistant materials to add to the longevity of the  sign; and,  • honouring the history of the area by naming the site the 'Mill Race  Centre'.  Stacey Kursikowski provided clarification regarding the maximum height  allowance within the Town's Permanent Sign By-law 7379-18, and the  MTO's three metre setback. Ms. Kursikowski stated that a minor  Page 4 of 8  Heritage Whitby Advisory Committee Minutes   January 12, 2021 - 7:00 PM    encroachment into the three metre setback would be permitted, and that  12 feet was the maximum height permitted for ground signs.  A discussion ensued regarding the character and design of the sign in  relation to the heritage district which included:  • areas that would be appropriate for ground signs such as  residential areas or buildings with large setbacks;  • the design of the sign and whether it complemented the heritage  streetscape;  • the oversized appearance of the sign in comparison to the natural  environment; and,  • taking away from the pedestrian character of the street.  A question and answer period ensued regarding:  • what the bottom measurement of the sign was;  • whether the sign could be reduced in size;  • whether the trees planted along the streetscape would block the  view of the sign as they matured;  • whether the sign could be turned inward, away from the road;  and,  • whether the sightlines for drivers turning off of Way Street onto  Baldwin Street/Highway 12 had been considered.  Councillor Newman suggested that Members of the Committee provide  Stacey Kursikowski with feedback regarding the design elements, size  and materials of the proposed sign.      Recommendation:    Moved By Rick McDonnell    That the Heritage Whitby Advisory Committee does not support the  ground sign as proposed and finds that it is not in keeping with the  Guideline for Signage in Historic Brooklin and Whitby. The Committee  recommends:  1. That the set back and location be revised and positioned so as to not  obstruct the heritage streetscape view to the south and north, or  interfere with the natural growth of the trees planted along the street;  2. That the sign conform with the 3 metre setback as required by the  MTO;  3. That the scale of the sign be reduced to ensure compatibility and  appropriateness within the Heritage Conservation District; and,  4. That the revised design be brought before the Committee for further  review.    Page 5 of 8  Heritage Whitby Advisory Committee Minutes   January 12, 2021 - 7:00 PM    Carried  5.

He advised of a petition from residents in the  neighbourhood requesting that Council reconsider the proposed re- designation from low to medium density. Mr. Klingler raised concerns  about traffic, noting that recent traffic calming initiatives in the area  included the installation of two stop signs on Promenade Drive. He  advised that traffic speeds were a concern, and the motorists were not  aware that Garden Street was a dead end. He noted that Promenade  Drive was not aligned with Robert Attersley Drive, and that the whole  area serves as a bypass for Taunton Road. He raised concerns  regarding the traffic, parking, the impact of the proposed development  on the subject land, the future six-storey seniors apartment building and  townhouse development, and the future eighteen-storey apartment  building, indicating that traffic and parking would continue to increase.  He expressed concerns regarding potential damage to the watershed,  and raised further concerns about the environmentally protected  property at the rear of the proposed development becoming a dumping  Page 2 of 14  Committee of the Whole Minutes   November 12, 2019 - 7:00 PM    area.

New and Unfinished Business - Planning and Development    5.1  Gas Tax Funds      Recommendation:    Moved By Mayor Mitchell    Whereas Canada has responded to the climate change emergency  Page 6 of 14  Committee of the Whole Minutes   November 12, 2019 - 7:00 PM    through commitments to a zero carbon future;     And Whereas there are global and national shifts in reducing  greenhouse gas emissions from transportation by reducing reliance on  fossil fuel powered vehicles; and,    And Whereas the Gas Tax Funds, which are permanent and much- valued sources of funding for municipal infrastructure priorities, derives  funding from fossil-fuel taxation, the use of which will be reduced in the  coming years as dependence on them decreases.

Highlights of the  presentation included:  • a detailed overview of the Whitby GO Station site;  • the proposed development and vision for the Whitby GO Station  site;   • examples and details of transit oriented development sites across  the Metrolinx Network including the Aldershot GO Station, the  Oakville GO Station, the Port Credit GO Station, the Mimico GO  Station, the East Harbour (Toronto), and Port Whitby;  • the significant interest in development at or near transit facilities;  • the positive attributes of the site including having the second  highest ridership within the GO Network, the proximity to natural  features and Downtown Whitby, the size of the site, and  opportunities to provide more affordable housing choices  compared to sites located closer to Downtown Toronto;  • the results of the preliminary assessment including that  residential condominiums would be deemed feasible by  developers while purpose-built office space would likely not be  deemed feasible in the short term; and,  Page 8 of 14  Committee of the Whole Minutes   November 12, 2019 - 7:00 PM    • the timeline for development of the site and what the Town could  do to facilitate development on the site.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee,  Mr. Bidulka and Ms. Huynh regarding:  • whether there would be an opportunity to address the imbalance  of residential and commercial development on the site to serve  the needs of the Town;  • details pertaining to the three year timeline for the Town to realize  transit-oriented development on the site; and,  • whether there would be any complications associated with the  Town developing its portion of land first.  It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 9.1, LS, 20-19, at  this time.    7.  Delegations    7.1  Kim Wright representing Uber Canada  Re: Legal and Enforcement Services Department Report, LS 18-19  Re: Proposed Amendments to the Private Transportation Services By- law    Refer to Item 9.3, LS 18-19  Kim Wright, representing Uber Canada, appeared before the Committee  and advised that she was the Principal and Founder of Wright  Strategies. She provided details regarding her background in politics  and government relations. Ms. Wright requested that the Committee  eliminate the recommendation for a per trip licensing fee and maintain  the existing flat rate licensing fee. She commented on the Town's open  for business attitude, and stated that an open for business attitude  implies reducing red tape as much as possible, and streamlining  regulations and fee structures in a way that makes sense for both the  Town and businesses that want to carry on business in the Town. She  noted that maintaining a flat rate fee would make sense from the Town's  perspective as well as for Uber. She advised that a flat fee was simple  to administer, that it would not require additional accounting or auditing,  that it was a predictable source of revenue that could be included in the  budget on an annual basis, and it was justifiable from a cost recovery  perspective. She commented on Uber's popularity with residents and  visitors in Whitby, noting that it was used by a wide range of users  including seniors, students, and people who do not want to drive or do  not drive. Ms. Wright advised that jurisdictions take different approaches  to fee structures for different reasons including size, population and  scope of use, but that the fee structure usually comes down to ease of  Page 9 of 14  Committee of the Whole Minutes   November 12, 2019 - 7:00 PM    use on the administration end. She suggested that maintaining the flat  rate fee would cost the Town less by not requiring the additional  accounting and auditing functions that would be required by including  per trip fees. She advised that from her client's perspective, per trip fees  would be a cumbersome process from a technology, accounting and  auditing perspective.   A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Ms. Wright regarding:  • whether the delegate agreed with the predicted higher revenue  received by the Town within a per trip fee structure;  • whether ridership within Whitby had increased or decreased in  comparison to other municipalities;  • the number of registered vehicles in Whitby, and the capacity to  obtain data on the number of vehicles in municipalities; and,  • clarification on other municipalities that charge a flat rate fee  versus a per trip fee.  It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 9.3, LS 28-19, at  this time.    8.  Correspondence    8.1  There was no correspondence.    9.  Staff Reports    9.1  Legal and Enforcement Services Department and Planning and  Development Department Joint Report, LS 20-19  Re: Market / Transit-Oriented Development Investigation – Whitby GO  Station  Discussion ensued between Members of Committee regarding:  • the benefits of attracting people who would like to live a vehicle  reduced or vehicle free life style at this location;  • addressing some of the growth pressures in the Port Whitby area;  and,  • the attraction of certain developers with a proven model.      Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Leahy    1. That Council receive Report LS 20-19 for information, together  with the attached report from Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP; and,  Page 10 of 14  Committee of the Whole Minutes   November 12, 2019 - 7:00 PM    2. That Council direct staff to take the initiatives set out in Report LS  20-19 to support the potential future sale of the Town's lands  adjacent to the Whitby GO Station, and to support the Whitby  Transit Village vision on the site.    Carried    It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 7.1, Delegation By  Kim Wright, at this time.    9.2  Legal and Enforcement Services Department Report, LS 17-19  Re: Proposed Amendments to the Property Standards By-law  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Staff regarding:  • whether the proposed by-law amendments would permit staff to  address the property located at 16 Baldwin Street;  • reviewing the heritage property enforcement provisions of the  proposed by-law amendment with the Heritage Whitby Advisory  Committee;  • the challenges and costs associated with the maintenance or  repair of heritage attributes and obtaining a heritage assessment;  and,  • the general response and processes for by-law enforcement  including issuing Property Standards Orders.      Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Leahy    That the Town Clerk be directed to bring forward a by-law to amend the  Property Standards By-law to give effect to the recommendations  contained in Report LS 17-19.    Note: The disposition of the matter, Item 9.2, was determined  through the deferral motion below.

Carried    9.3  Legal and Enforcement Services Department Report, LS 18-19  Re: Proposed Amendments to the Private Transportation Services By- law   A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Staff regarding:  • whether a flat rate fee model would result in the taxi industry  requesting changes to their fees;  • the methods used to measure and report the number of trips;  • whether the per trip fee structure would result in additional  administrative work;  • the types of enforcement and when and how this would take  place; and,  • the ability for staff to undertake auditing and accounting.      Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Leahy    1.

Delegations    4.1  Aaron Platt, Partner, Davies Howe LLP on behalf of 70 Taunton Storage  GP Corporation  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 06-21   Official Plan Amendment and Zoning By-law Amendment Applications,  20 Taunton Road East, Calloway REIT (Whitby NE), File Number: DEV- 16-20 (OPA-2020-W/02, Z-11-20)     Refer to Item 6.2, PL 06-21  Aaron Platt, Partner, Davies Howe LLP appeared before Council and  stated that 70 Taunton Storage GP Corporation are the owners  immediately to the east of the Calloway REIT property. He advised that  Page 3 of 31  Regular Council Minutes   March 08, 2021 - 7:00 PM    he had submitted correspondence regarding the application and had  received a response from Staff. He indicated that about a year ago 70  Taunton Storage GP Corporation was before Council for approval of an  Official Plan and Zoning By-law amendment for their property. He stated  that their proposal had its principle building on the west side of their  property with a drive aisle on the east side of the building. He noted that  Staff raised concerns about the potential for connectivity of the two  properties as both properties were commercial and were accessed by  the same arterial road. He advised that at that time, the planner for  Calloway REIT raised concerns about the proposed location of the  building on the 70 Taunton Storage GP Corporation property as it would  reduce opportunities for connectivity to Baldwin Street South. He  indicated that these comments were made after Calloway REIT knew  that their building would be constructed on the existing drive aisle  through their site that could have connected the two properties. He  stated that his client revised their proposal to allow for the continuation  of the drive aisle in response to comments made at the Public Meeting  by representatives of Calloway REIT. He noted that Calloway REIT then  appealed 70 Taunton Storage CP Corporation's application on the basis  of a lack of connectivity. He stated that the land use planner for  Calloway REIT provided testimony about policies in the Official Plan and  Secondary Plan about comprehensive planning for integrated site  circulation and connectivity, shared access, and limiting the number of  access points in this location. He reiterated that the application before  Council forecloses on the opportunity for connectivity between the  properties.      Moved By Councillor Newman  Seconded by Councillor Drumm    That the rules of procedure be suspended to allow the delegation to  exceed the five minute speaking limit.    Carried    Mr. Platt continued his delegation and advised that the proposal would  result in traffic having to circulate off of one site and onto the  neighbouring site using the arterial road and that this would disrupt  movement on sidewalks. He stated that the design of the site should be  future-proofed and that it does not reflect the requirements in the Official  Plan. He concluded by requesting that Council deny the applications  and refer the matter to Staff to require the applicant to identify the  location of a drive aisle in order to allow for connectivity between the  properties and Baldwin Street South.    Page 4 of 31  Regular Council Minutes   March 08, 2021 - 7:00 PM    4.2  Allan Scully, SmartCentres, David Bronskill, Goodmans LLP, and Mike  Dror, Bousfields  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 06-21  Official Plan Amendment and Zoning By-law Amendment Applications,  20 Taunton Road East, Calloway REIT (Whitby NE), File Number: DEV- 16-20 (OPA-2020-W/02, Z-11-20)     Refer to Item 6.2, PL 06-21  David Bronskill, Goodmans LLP appeared before Council and advised  that he would respond to the previous delegation. He indicated that  comprehensive planning has occurred for the two properties. He  referenced a memorandum from Staff which indicated that it is no longer  necessary for the Town to require access between the two properties.  He indicated that in the past his client wanted an opportunity to  undertake comprehensive planning between the two sites and noted  that the reason for his client's appeal was due to a failure to confirm the  final access between the lands and easements that may be required. He  noted that his client's appeal was referred to site plan approval to  resolve these concerns. He indicated that the comments made by Mr.  Platt regarding the approval process for easements and comprehensive  planning are contrary to materials he and his planner filed at the Land  Planning Appeal Tribunal (LPAT) and suggested that 70 Taunton GP  Storage Corporation was attempting to delay approval of these  applications. He requested that Council endorse the Staff  recommendation and approve the applications, noting that LPAT has no  ability to force the Town to decide whether to retain or extend  easements.       4.3  Rodger Miller, Miller Planning Services, and Andrew Sgro, Broccolini  Construction  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 07-21  Official Plan and Zoning By-law Amendment Applications, Northeast  Corner of Garrard Road and Conlin Road, Garrard Limited Partnership,  File Number: DEV-22-20 (OPA-2020-W/04, Z-13-20)     Refer to Item 6.3, PL 07-21  Mr. Miller, Miller Planning Services appeared before Council indicating  that he and Mr. Sgro were available to answer questions related to the  applications.

Tellis, Manager of Treasury Services  C. Harris, Town Clerk  S. Cassel, Deputy Clerk    Regrets:  Regional Councillor (vacant)    1.  Declarations of Pecuniary Interest    1.1  There were no declarations of pecuniary interest.    2.  Presentations    2.1  Office of the Town Clerk Report, CLK 08-16  Re: Method of Filling Vacancy on Council      Resolution # 88-16    Moved By Councillor Drumm  Seconded By Councillor Leahy    1. That Report CLK 08-16 of the Office of the Town Clerk be  received for information; and,  2. That, pursuant to Section 262(1) of the Municipal Act, 2001, the  Council of the Corporation of the Town of Whitby hereby declares  the office of Regional Councillor to be vacant and directs the  Clerk to so notify the Regional Clerk of the vacancy.   Special Council Minutes   February 25, 2016 - 7:00 PM      Carried    The following individuals registered as delegates, after the publication of  the agenda, and spoke to CLK 08-16.    Bob Hartley, 340 Regal Briar Street, appeared before Council and  provided a copy of his delegation to Members of Council.  He stated that  he understood there were three options to fill the vacancy of Regional  Councillor being an election, appointment of an individual or  appointment of the runner up in the last municipal election who had the  next highest votes. Mr. Hartley stated that an election or appointing the  runner up was the most democratic way to fill the seat.  He commented  that appointing another individual gives the perception of favouritism.   He stated that the candidates that ran in the 2014 election had spent a  lot of time and money on their campaigns and that constituents had cast  their votes to elect the regional councillors for the Town.  He commented  that if an individual that was not part of the race for the seat of regional  councillor in 2014 was appointed, that it would be making a mockery of  the election process.     John Dolstra, 23 Regency Crescent, appeared before Council and  stated that he was thankful for the opportunity to speak and express his  opinion on the vacancy of the Regional Councillor seat. He stated that  he was the runner up in the 2014 Municipal Election and that he had  served in the past on Whitby Town Council and the School Board. Mr.  Dolstra requested that he be considered for the Regional Councillor  seat. He stated that with the length of the remaining term of council, it  was important to fill the seat and that he was of the opinion that if  Council should appoint an individual that it should be the runner up in  the 2014 Election.  He continued by stating that if Council should choose  to not appoint, that a by-election be called to allow the residents to  decide on who should fill the seat.      Ron Trbovich, 4 Lacey Drive, appeared before Council and stated that  he was thankful for the opportunity to provide input and comment. He  stated that he had been a resident of Whitby since 1984. Mr. Trbovich  commented that he had a great deal of confidence in Whitby Council  noting that they had recently passed the annual budget, adopted a  strategic plan and were working well together. He recommended that  Council vote, by secret ballot, to appoint an existing Ward Councillor to  the Regional seat and subsequently hold a by-election for the vacant  ward seat saving residents the cost of a town-wide by-election.  Questions were raised to the Town Clerk regarding the ability for  Council to vote by secret ballot.    Page 2 of 5  Special Council Minutes   February 25, 2016 - 7:00 PM    C. Harris, Town Clerk, confirmed that the Municipal Act did not allow  voting by secret ballot and that this option was not available to Council.    The Chair opened the floor for comments from the public.  There were  no members of the public present to speak on the matter.     Detailed discussion ensued regarding:   the options of appointing a current ward councillor to the Regional  seat;   feedback from residents in that it was not favourable to have a  by-election at this time;   respect for taxpayer's dollars;   voter fatigue in the number of elections in the past few years;   the democratic process of elections;   options for filling vacancies under the Municipal Act that leaves  the decision to municipal Council;   the importance of filling the Regional seat so that Whitby does not  lose out on voting on important issues at the Regional level;   keeping the momentum of Whitby Council moving forward in their  shared vision for the Town; and,   appointing Derrick Gleed as Regional Councillor and filling the  north ward seat through a by-election.    Mayor Mitchell asked Councillor Gleed if he would accept the  nomination to be appointed to the office of Regional Councillor.    Councillor Gleed accepted and consented to the nomination.    Resolution # 89-16    Moved By Councillor Drumm  Seconded By Councillor Roy    1. That Council proceed with a direct appointment to fill the vacancy  of Regional Councillor at this evening's Special Council meeting;  and,  2. That Derrick Gleed be appointed to the office of Regional  Councillor and the Clerk be directed to notify the Regional Clerk  of the appointment.    Carried    Resolution # 90-16    Page 3 of 5  Special Council Minutes   February 25, 2016 - 7:00 PM    Moved By Councillor Yamada  Seconded By Councillor Leahy    That leave be granted to introduce By-law Number 7106-16, being a By- law to appoint Derrick Gleed to fill the vacancy for the office of Regional  Councillor, and to dispense with the reading of the by-law by the Clerk  and the same be considered read and passed and that the Mayor and  the Clerk sign the same and Seal of the Corporation be thereto affixed.    Carried    Councillor Gleed was provided with the Declaration of Office and read  the Declaration aloud.    Councillor Gleed signed the Declaration of Office and it was  commissioned by the Town Clerk.    Councillor Gleed assumed the seat of Regional Councillor.    Discussion ensued with respect to the North Ward vacancy due to the  appointment of Derrick Gleed as Regional Councillor.  W. Mar, Town  Solicitor, advised Members of Council that in accordance with the  Municipal Act, Council at its next regularly scheduled Council meeting,  to be held on Monday, February 29, 2016, would declare the North  Ward seat vacant.    Further discussion ensued with respect to scheduling a Special Council  Meeting to hear options on filling the North Ward vacant seat after  Council had formally declared the seat vacant.  3.

Stephanie Kwast, representing Brookfield Residential (Ontario) Station  No. 3 Limited, provided an overview of the application.   The Chair opened the floor for comments from the public.  Linda Mastrobuono, 216 Brock Street South, raised concerns with the  size of the proposed development, traffic congestion it may cause, and  the impact the development could have on existing parking in the area.  Ms. Mastrobuono stated that removal of municipal parking lot # 4  needed to be addressed and residents needed to be provided with an  alternate parking solution. She stated that municipal parking lot # 5  needed to be enhanced to provide additional parking spaces to  accommodate downtown businesses, their staff and their clients. She  stated that her business and Valentino's Grande Salon require a total of  80 parking spaces and that parking in the area is already insufficient.   Ms. Mastrobuono indicated that business owners were concerned about  the upcoming construction and the impact that it will have on their  businesses. Ms. Mastrobuono also indicated the need for a cross walk  for customers to safely walk from municipal parking lot # 5 to various  businesses in Downtown Whitby.      Mark Woitzik, 244 Brock Street, raised concerns with the development  charge exemption that was available for the proposed development. He  stated that certain classes of small business were not eligible for the  same exemption and stated that this was a flaw in the Town's  Community Improvement Plans (CIP).   The Chair advised Mr. Woitzik that the issue of the CIP was not within  the scope of the public meeting and he advised Mr. Woitzik to detail his  concerns through an email so that they could be considered by Council  at an appropriate time.  Mr. Woitzik raised concerns related to insufficient parking and stated  that as business owners they had to pay cash in lieu for parking and an  additional $200,000 over and above development charges. He stated  that the development would remove two parking lots from Downtown  Whitby and his business would suffer due to lack of parking spaces. He  also stated that the Town has not yet addressed the parking problem in  Downtown Whitby. Mr. Woitzik asked if Members of Council plan on  exempting small business owners from development charges; if the  developer will be required to pay cash in lieu for parking spaces that are  Page 2 of 8  Public Meetings Minutes   March 25, 2019 - 7:00 PM    removed; if the developer will be required to replace the parking spaces  that are removed; if the Town would provide additional parking in  Downtown Whitby; and, if the developer is not required to pay cash in  lieu for parking, would his business be entitled to a refund for the cash in  lieu it paid during development?  Elaine Palmer, 404 Peel Street, raised concern with the proposed high- rise development in Downtown Whitby. She stated that high-rise  buildings would destroy the heritage character of Downtown Whitby and  would add to congestion in the area. She raised concerns with Whitby  losing its character as a senior friendly town, traffic congestion, and  safety.   Kam Rathee, 112 Colborne Street East, stated concerns relating to  parking. He indicated that he was excited about the development and  hoped that the development would make Downtown Whitby more  vibrant. He indicated that he supported the development.

Mike Zavershnik and Joey Giaimo, representing High St. Manor at 300  High Street, provided an overview of the application.   The Chair opened the floor for comments from the public.   Cristal Diemer-Ewles and Mark Ewles, 303 High Street, raised concerns  that the new development would result in additional traffic, add to  congestion, and impact the existing neighbourhood. Ms. Diemer-Ewles  stated that High Street had aging infrastructure and lacked curb space  for vehicle parking. She stated that the area had ditches and culverts  and that the development could create groundwater issues. She  expressed concern that the construction would destroy mature trees on  the property.    The Chair asked the proponent to comment on the concern related to  mature trees on the property.   The proponent stated that the proposed building would be located in a  clearing on the property. He stated that 3 small trees would be impacted  by the development and that mature trees would not be destroyed.   Lesley Dath and Brian Heringer, 117 High Street, raised concerns that  the 4-storey building would cast shadows into neighbour's backyards  and create privacy issues. The neighbourhood used culverts, and they  were concerned if the culverts would be able to handle drainage from  the new development.  Ms. Dath stated that development would add to  parking issues and would cause congestion in the neighbourhood. She  stated that the building would be within 12 feet from the street and that  in her opinion would be too close. Mr. Heringer stated that the current  zoning permits one building on the lot, whereas the proposed  development was for two buildings. He stated that the maximum  permitted lot coverage was 14 percent and the development proposed  was at 21 percent. He also indicated that the development would result  in congestion and traffic concerns.      Kerry Maxwell, 300 High Street, stated that the existing building had  long-term tenants. She indicated that several tenants chose to live at the  location due to its proximity to Fairview Lodge. She stated that the  Page 4 of 8  Public Meetings Minutes   March 25, 2019 - 7:00 PM    building housed young families with children, nurses who worked at  Fairview Lodge, and other tenants who chose to live there due to the  building's proximity to services. She stated that an additional  development in the same location would offer more people with an  opportunity to enjoy the benefits of the location.    Hazel Holt, 300 High Street, stated that High Street was used for  parking by people in the neighbourhood and tenants of the building.

File: DEV-21-18 (OPA-2018-W/06, Z-33-18,  SP-43-18)  G. Wilson, Planner I, provided a PowerPoint presentation which  included an overview of the application.  Michael Fry, from D.G. Biddle and Associated Ltd., representing Devon  Downs Developments Ltd., provided an overview of the application.   The Chair opened the floor for comments from the public.   Patricia Weber, 8 William Davidson Street, raised concerns about the  creek running behind her property and asked if the proposed  development would cause environmental concerns. She expressed  privacy concerns about the proposed development. Ms. Weber stated  that the proposed development would add to traffic congestion, making  it difficult to turn onto Rossland Road and that the development would  impact mature trees and the scenery from her backyard. She stated that  the creek is home to wildlife and she expressed concerns that this area  would be destroyed.    The Chair requested that the proponent comment on the environmental  assessment report.  The proponent stated that an environmental study was completed. The  results indicated that the creek was a drainage ditch and not a creek.  The former creek in the area was diverted many years ago by a  development in the adjacent area. The report stated that there were no  environmental issues with the proposed development.   Amy Duga, 21 Pogson Drive, stated concerns with losing the dense  wooded lot behind her home, privacy in her backyard, and her quiet  neighbourhood. She indicated that these features were the main  Page 5 of 8  Public Meetings Minutes   March 25, 2019 - 7:00 PM    attractions when she bought her property. She requested that a 10 foot  high sound proof fence be built between her property and the proposed  development. Ms. Duga stated that the location of the amenity area in  the development was behind the building and she requested that the  developer provide security and lighting to ensure safety of residents and  neighbours.   Phil Egginton, 90 Bedell Court, raised concerns regarding the proposed  development's compatibility with the existing community. He stated that  most homes in the area were bungalows and the 4-storey development  would change the look of the neighbourhood. Mr. Egginton requested  access to the environmental assessment report and stated that the  creek was a wildlife sanctuary.   The Chair advised that Central Lake Ontario Conservation Authority  (CLOCA) had reviewed the report. The proponent confirmed the report  had been reviewed by CLOCA.   Carolyne Mcnabney, 14 William Davidson Street, asked when the  CLOCA report was issued and indicated that CLOCA had not shared the  environmental assessment report with neighbours when they requested.  Ms. Mcnabney noted that the creek hosted wildlife and rare birds and  was part of Corbett Creek which flows into Lake Ontario. She raised  concerns with the height of the development, the existing topography,  and asked if the area would be levelled for construction. She stated that  loss of privacy and constant shadowing were concerns.  Ms. Mcnabney  raised concerns with the size of proposed development and stated that  the neighbourhood is not suitable for a high-rise building. She added  that the community needed to be provided with more information and  indicated that the mature trees on the property needed to be maintained.  She stated that adding high cedars and privacy fencing would help to  maintain privacy to existing residents in the neighbourhood.   The Chair requested Planning and Development Department Staff to  comment on the environmental assessment report.   Planning and Development Department Staff stated that reports and  documents submitted by the proponent would be analyzed. Staff added  that they had received the environmental assessment report in  December 2018.   William Espie, 18 William Davidson Street, raised concerns relating to  privacy and the proposed 4-storey building casting shadows on  neighbouring homes. He noted safety concerns related to traffic  congestion that the development would cause.     Patty Pietrow, 17 William Davidson Street, raised concern with having  Page 6 of 8  Public Meetings Minutes   March 25, 2019 - 7:00 PM    limited information about the proposed development. She stated that the  proposed 4-storey structure was too tall and not compatible with the  existing density of the neighbourhood. She expressed concern about  shadows from the proposed development. She added that zoning  changes would encourage other high-rise developments within the area.  She asked if the Oshawa Executive Airport was consulted as the  proposed development would be within the flight path. Ms. Peitrow  raised concern related to on-street parking and wanted information  about visitor's parking for the proposed development. She raised  concerns with parking of construction vehicles during and after the  construction, mature trees being cut down, and stated that the  proponent needed to provide a privacy fence.  Christina Hall, 31 Lloyd Gibson Crescent, raised concerns that there  were empty parcels of land in the area that could be used for future  high-rise developments and change the character of the neighbourhood.  She indicated concerns with density and said turning onto Rossland  Road would be difficult due to added traffic congestion from the  proposed development. The Chair advised that documents and reports  pertaining to the proposed development were available for public  viewing in the Town's Planning and Development Department. The  Chair requested that the Planning and Development Department Staff  speak to the Oshawa Executive Airport issue.  Planning and Development Department Staff stated that the proponent  had submitted an airport proximity report and that they were awaiting  response from the City of Oshawa.    Michael Newell, 22 William Davidson, raised concerns with the zoning  by-law amendment and increasing the height of the development from 3  to 4-storeys. He stated that the proposed development was in line with  the east–west approach for a runway at the Oshawa Executive Airport.  He stated that the planes circled over the intersection of Rossland Road  and Garrard Road before landing at the airport. He raised safety  concerns as trainee pilots flew planes in the area at low altitudes, and  that the approach path would be over the proposed development,  raising the possibility of an accident. Mr. Newell stated the proposed  development would require aircraft warning lights installed on the roof  and this would add to light pollution for neighbouring residents. He noted  that the proposed development would depreciate the value of homes.   Adam Hillen, 3315 Garrard Road, raised environmental concerns with  the development. He stated that the area had saturated soil and asked  for access to the environmental assessment report. Mr. Hillen stated  that a driveway going to a nearby Church had a drainage ditch which  ran from west to east on the south side of the property and that this ditch  was filled in December 2018. He asked if the modifications to the  Page 7 of 8  Public Meetings Minutes   March 25, 2019 - 7:00 PM    drainage ditch were part of the development, and if so, was drainage  considered before the environmental assessment report was prepared.   The Chair advised that the environmental assessment report was  available in the Town's Planning and Development Department and  stated that the Town Staff would examine the drainage ditch issue.    There were no further submissions from the public.   The Chair asked the proponent if they would be willing to organize a  public open house for area residents to discuss their concerns in more  detail.   The proponent indicated a public open house would be an option, but he  needed to confirm this with the owner of the proposed development.   The meeting adjourned at 8:56 p.m.      Kevin Narraway, Manager of Legislative  Services/Deputy Town Clerk      Page 8 of 8

Planning and Development  Councillor Mulcahy assumed the Chair.  5.1  Presentations  There were no presentations.  5.2  Delegations  5.2.1 Craig Wilson, Resident (In-Person Attendance)  Re: PDP 50-24, Planning and Development (Planning Services)  Department Report  Official Plan, Draft Plan of Subdivision, and Zoning By-law  Amendment Applications, Nordeagle Development Ltd., Vacant  Lands North of Victoria Street West between Montecorte Street and  Jim Flaherty Street, File Number: DEV-03-18 (OPA-2018-W/02,  SW-2018-01, Z-08-18)    Refer to Item 5.4.2, PDP 50-24  Craig Wilson, Resident, appeared before the Committee and stated  that he was a resident in Whitby Shores and that he was not  opposed to development in the area. He raised concerns about the  proposed development resulting in a significant increase in  residences and commercial businesses and the impact that the  additional vehicular traffic would have in the area. Mr. Wilson stated  that there was only one vehicular access between Henry Street /  Watson Street West and Jim Flaherty Street / Gordon Street, noting  that the single connection was Victoria Street West along the north  edge of Victoria Fields. He stated that there would be a significant  impact on Whitby Fire and Emergency Services (WFES) response  times in Whitby Shores should there be a major accident or  congestion on Victoria Street west of Henry Street or on Highway  401. Mr. Wilson advised that emergency response vehicles would  need to reroute and/or the area would need to be served by Whitby  Fire Station 4 on Dundas Street West or the Town of Ajax. Mr.       3  Wilson cited specific portions of the Whitby Fire and Emergency  Services Master Fire Plan, the Durham Transportation Master Plan  2017, Staff report PW 16-12, and the Town of Whitby Official Plan  related to concerns about WFES responding to emergency calls on  Highway 412 northbound from Highway 401 eastbound lanes, the  reference to Victoria Street as the Emergency Detour Route for  Highway 401, that Metrolinx considered Victoria Street an important  transportation corridor and potential HOV lanes, and the potential  for an overpass on Highway 401. He recommended that the  subdivision agreement be conditional upon the Annes Street  overpass being constructed over Highway 401 prior to any  significant occupancy to better facilitate WFES response to the  Whitby Shores area and protect the health and safety of people  living, working or visiting the neighbourhood. Mr. Wilson stated that  alternatively another east-west road should be constructed east to  west to the north or south of the potential choke point to connect  Jim Flaherty Street to Henry Street or Gordon Street to Watson  Street West. Mr. Wilson stated that he was opposed to the  proposed development unless the traffic and safety concerns were  addressed to ensure the safety of the people in the Whitby Shores  area and those that travel through this corridor.   5.2.2 Cheryl Gaw Penner, Resident (Virtual Attendance)  Re: PDP 50-24, Planning and Development (Planning Services)  Department Report  Official Plan, Draft Plan of Subdivision, and Zoning By-law  Amendment Applications, Nordeagle Development Ltd., Vacant  Lands North of Victoria Street West Between Montecorte Street  and Jim Flaherty Street, File Number: DEV-03-18 (OPA-2018- W/02, SW-2018-01, Z-08-18)    Refer to Item 5.4.2, PDP 50-24  Cheryl Gaw Penner, Resident, advised that she agreed with the  previous delegate's comments and concerns.

Discussion ensued between Members of Committee regarding:   victims of intimate partner violence not being aware of the  various supports in place and how Town Staff can amplify  messaging about how victims of intimate partner violence  can seek assistance;   the expansion of the Denise House due to the increased  needs particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic;   the need for supports be made more public and the need for  public education and support; and,   the lack of shelters for victims and lack of funding to assist in  supporting shelters.  Recommendation:  Moved by Councillor Shahid       11  Whereas there is a nationwide intimate partner violence (IPV)  crisis, in which more than 4 in 10 (6.2 million) women and 1 in 3  men have experienced intimate partner violence, and rates  increased 19% between 2014 and 2022; and,   Whereas 78% of victims of police-reported intimate partner violence  in 2022 were women and girls, and in 2019 rates were 3.5 times  higher among women than men; and,   Whereas intimate partner violence, in 2009, was estimated to cost  $7.4 billion annually to the public system, impacting municipal  budgets for public safety and housing; and,    Whereas rural, remote, and northern communities experience  disproportionate rates of IPV, with risk of IPV 75% higher for  women in rural communities than women in urban communities,  and 73% of survivors in rural communities at high risk of being in  severe or extreme danger of being killed; and,    Whereas Indigenous women are 3 times more likely to experience  IPV than non-Indigenous women, and are 8 times more likely to be  murdered by intimate partners than non-Indigenous women,  because of the intersections between colonialism, racism, and  misogyny; and,    Whereas IPV is a phenomenon which affects Black and racialized  women, women with disabilities, and 2SLGBTQIA+ people  disproportionately; and,   Whereas women's shelters nationwide consistently struggle with  permanent funding to provide essential transitional, family, and  permanent housing solutions for women fleeing IPV, and as  COVID-oriented funding expires and piecemeal efforts to fund  women's shelter systems result in women experiencing IPV being  continually at risk; and,    Whereas the federal government has made gender-based violence  (GBV) and IPV priorities across ministries and agencies through the  National Strategy to Address Gender-Based Violence and the  National Action Plan to End Gender-based Violence, signing  bilateral agreements with provinces and territories, but gaps  remain.      Now therefore, be it resolved:       12  1. That the Council of the Town of Whitby calls on the federal  government to create a permanent fund, open to local  governments and community organizations, for the  construction of shelters and transitional housing for women  and survivors of intimate partner violence, including housing  appropriate for Indigenous, 2SLGBTQIA+ people, and  persons with disabilities, with a dedicated rural, remote, and  northern (RRN) stream; and,  2. That the Council of the Town of Whitby calls on the federal  government to work with the provinces and territories to  provide permanent operational funding, open to local  governments and community organizations, for shelters,  transitional housing, and supportive housing for women and  survivors of intimate partner violence, including Indigenous,  2SLGBTQIA+ people, and persons with disabilities.  Carried    6.5.2 Immediate Federal Government Support Required for Asylum  Claimants in Municipalities  A brief discussion ensued between Members of Committee  regarding:   the cost of and lack of financial support for asylum seekers;  and,   the significant demand for limited resources.   Recommendation:  Moved by Councillor Shahid  Whereas municipalities have been at the forefront of supporting  asylum claimants and refugees and providing essential settlement  and housing services; and,   Whereas the rapid and sharp increase of asylum claims in Toronto,  Montreal, Hamilton and other municipalities, particularly in the  Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA), are putting municipal  governments under significant pressure; and,        13  Whereas without federal action, asylum claimants will not have  permanent shelter and housing options once they leave temporary  accommodations, and the current crisis will continue to grow; and,   Whereas refugees and asylum claimants make up over 40% of  Hamilton's population in shelters, and is creating massive pressure  on Hamilton's already overwhelmed shelter system that is under  resourced to meet the unique and complex needs of asylum  claimants; and,   Whereas the supports provided to municipalities to receive asylum  claimants are often short-term and focused on emergency  response and shelter, but do not ensure permanent settlement and  housing options for asylum claimants, including a focus on  homeless prevention and long-term stability; and,   Whereas the crisis of asylum claimants has inextricable links to the  housing, homelessness and mental health crises in Canada and  the immense pressure on municipal shelter, transitional and  supportive housing systems; and,   Whereas equity-deserving communities are disproportionately  represented in asylum claimant populations seeking immediate  necessary support which can also lead to further stigmatization and  experiences of racism, discrimination, and harassment; and,   Whereas action on behalf of the federal government and investing  in supports to combat racism, specifically anti-Black racism, is  imperative as asylum seekers commonly face racism and other  forms of discrimination and hate; and,   Whereas municipalities across Canada are committed to fostering  diverse, inclusive and welcoming communities for all individuals  seeking asylum and tackling anti-Black racism and other forms of  racism; and,   Whereas Hamilton, Toronto and other municipalities in the Greater  Toronto Hamilton Area (GTHA) have been advocating for additional  federal supports for asylum claimants over the past year.  Now therefore, be it resolved:  1. That the Council of the Town of Whitby strongly urge the  federal government to take immediate action to support       14  asylum claimants in Canadian municipalities by taking the  following actions:  a. Immediately provide financial support and  reimbursements directly to municipalities to address the  immediate short-term needs of asylum claimants and  refugees through top-ups to the Canada Housing Benefit  and the Interim Housing Assistance Program (IHAP);  b. An ongoing commitment of Interim Housing Assistance  Program (IHAP) funding to address estimated annual  costs for refugees in 2024, and commit to future funding  until the demand for shelter returns to sustainable levels;  c. Collaborate with municipal governments to develop a  long-term strategy to enhance capacity of local  governments to effectively support asylum claimants and  refugees, including through the development of tripartite  agreements between municipalities, provinces and  territories and the federal government to enhance cross- government coordination in providing immediate supports  to asylum claimants;  d. Recognizing that the rise in asylum seeking populations  pursuing refuge in Canada is occurring in the midst of a  housing crisis, provide additional funding through  National Housing Strategy programs and the Canada  Housing Benefit to support asylum claimants in the  medium- and long-term;  e. That the federal government broaden the eligibility for  federally-funded settlement services to include asylum  claimants who currently can only access provincially- funded services and also that settlement services be  funded to support newcomers with housing searches as  at present they mostly limited to orientation, language  instruction, and employment; and,  f. Extend and make permanent the Rapid Housing Initiative  with another intake in 2024/25 to enable municipalities to  invest in supportive housing on an urgent basis and  relieve pressure on the shelter system, and work with the  provinces and territories to ensure that supportive units       15  have wrap-around health and social supports and long- term operating funding.  Carried    6.5.3 Federal Support for Food Banks  Discussion ensued between Members of Committee regarding:   food security initiatives being the majority of applications  through the Mayor's Community Development Fund;   the rise in homelessness rates and the increased need for  local food banks throughout the community; and,   recognizing systemic inequalities such as housing and lack  of social support and the need for funding.  Recommendation:  Moved by Councillor Shahid  Whereas financial and affordability pressures related to soaring  mortgage and rent costs, inflated grocery costs, stagnating wages,  and limited avenues for social assistance have pushed significantly  more people toward food insecurity; and,  Whereas people with fixed incomes, including seniors and social  assistance recipients, are at extremely high risk of food insecurity  and continue to struggle disproportionately as their dollars are  being spread thinner; and,   Whereas challenges are also continuing to grow for working  people, renters,  and people living in remote and northern regions  of Canada; and,  Whereas racialized Canadians are disproportionately impacted by  each of these factors, as the systemic barriers they face have been  further exacerbated by  the economic and affordability crisis of the  past few years; and,  Whereas food banks were established as a temporary solution to  the increasing cost of food and needs in the community but are now  part of a system that government and communities heavily and  increasingly rely on; and,       16  Whereas it has been more than a full year since Food Banks  Canada sounded the alarms in the HungerCount 2022 report,  calling for action to be taken immediately to help the millions of  struggling Canadians from coast to coast to coast; and,  Where the Food Banks Canada report from March 2023, indicates  that nearly 2 million Canadians accessed food banks across the  country, a 32 per cent increase from March 2022 and a 78.5 per  cent increase from March 2019, which is the highest year-over-year  increase in usage ever reported; and,  Whereas the ""Emergency Food Security Fund"" was established by  the Federal Government to address urgent needs during the  pandemic but food insecurity has only worsened, and the Federal  Government no longer has a program to provide ongoing support to  Food Banks; and,  Whereas the majority of support received by food banks is through  community fundraising and donations but given financial pressures  faced by individuals, these donations are declining; and,  Whereas in certain communities, people who were donating to food  banks are now instead accessing the food bank; and,  Whereas the need to address the food insecurity crisis touches on  many of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) focus  areas, including the Inclusive Communities focus area.    Now therefore be it resolved that:  The Council of the Town of Whitby calls on the Federal  Government to help address the food insecurity crisis by providing  emergency funding to food banks, food rescue agencies, and  farmers markets providing emergency food assistance, and  recognize the systemic issues involved in food bank usage,  including affordability, inequality, core housing need and insufficient  social supports, in order to end food insecurity.  Carried    6.5.4 Harassment of Elected Local Government Officials  Councillor Shahid introduced a motion regarding harassment of  elected local government officials.       17  Recommendation:  Moved by Councillor Shahid  Whereas in recent years, there has been an alarming rise in  incidents of harassment, intimidation and acts of violence aimed at  elected local government officials, compounding the already  strenuous work conditions faced by many local leaders and  hindering their retention; and,   Whereas women, particularly Black and racialized women, are  disproportionately targeted by violence and harassment toward  elected officials; and,   Whereas increasing the number of elected women, Black and  racialized, and 2SLGBTQIA+ representatives in Canada is a priority  for local governments and the federal government; and,   Whereas severe abuse, both online and in-person, has the  potential to discourage underrepresented groups from joining and  remaining engaged in local politics, limiting the diversity of opinion  needed in healthy democracies; and,   Whereas all elected officials have an ability to show leadership on  this issue by modeling behaviour, and should always strive to  elevate debate, embrace differences of opinion, disagree  respectfully and focus on issues of policy and substance.  Now therefore, be it resolved:  1. That the Council of the Town of Whitby request that the  federal government, work with provinces, territories, and  local governments, including through the Federation of  Canadian Municipalities, to identify and implement measures  to protect elected local government officials, their family  members, and staff – especially women, members of Black  and racialized communities, and 2SLGBTQIA+ individuals,  persons with disabilities, and Indigenous people – from  harassment, intimidation, and threats, thereby reinforcing a  unified front to safeguard democracy; and,  2. That the Council of the Town of Whitby calls on all elected  officials of all orders of government to lead by example,  demonstrating civility and mutual respect for their political  counterparts.       18  Carried    7.  Adjournment  Recommendation:  Moved by Councillor Shahid  That the meeting adjourn.  Carried  The meeting adjourned at 8:06 p.m."

Carried    9.4  Memorandum from H. Ellis, Council and Committee Coordinator, dated  February 2, 2024 re: Whitby Sustainability Advisory Committee Request  that Council Support the Ontario Energy Board's Decision to end the Gas  Pipeline Subsidy       21  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Council and  Staff regarding the differing information presented by Durham Region  Home Builder's Association and Enbridge Gas Inc. in response to the  Ontario Energy Board's decision to end the gas pipeline subsidy.   Resolution # 50-24  Moved by Councillor Lundquist  Seconded by Councillor Lee  Whereas residents are struggling with energy bill increases and need  relief; and,    Whereas natural gas is no longer the cheapest way to heat homes  because electric heat pumps are now much more efficient, can provide all  heating needs even in cold climates, and result in far lower energy bills  compared to gas heating; and,    Whereas natural gas is methane gas, which is a fossil fuel that causes  approximately one-third of Ontario's GHG emissions, and must be phased  out because it is inconsistent with all climate targets, while heat pumps  result in the lowest GHG emissions and are consistent with a zero-carbon  future; and,    Whereas the Ontario Energy Board (OEB) decided to end a subsidy for  methane gas pipelines to be built in new construction developments,  effective 2025, finding that this would lower energy bills for existing gas  customers and improve affordability for new homebuyers, but this decision  is at risk of being overturned by the provincial government; and,    Whereas the OEB decision will help lower energy bills and encourage  heating systems that are consistent with climate targets and plans; and,    Whereas the construction of new methane gas pipelines, which have 60- year lifetimes, should not be subsidized because they are inconsistent  with the Town's climate targets and will result in higher carbon emissions,  higher energy bills, higher future decarbonization retrofit costs to phase  out fossil fuel heating, and a continued financial drain as dollars leave the  province to pay for fossil fuels extracted in other jurisdictions.    Now therefore, be it resolved:        22  1. That the Town of Whitby expresses its support for the decision of  the Ontario Energy Board to end the gas pipeline subsidy and ask  the Ontario Government to allow the decision to stand; and,  2. That this resolution be circulated to Premier Doug Ford; the  Minister of Energy, Todd Smith; the Minister of Finance, Peter  Bethlenfalvy; the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, Paul  Calandra; the Associate Minister of Housing, Rob Flack; President  of AMO, Colin Best, the Region of Durham, and all local Ontario  municipalities requesting support of the proposed changes.

Ontario (Ministry of Labour)  Resolution # 51-24  Moved by Councillor Lundquist  Seconded by Councillor Lee  Whereas in 2015 the City of Greater Sudbury (""Sudbury"") entered into a  contract with a contractor to complete a project in its downtown core; and,   Whereas the contract provided that the contractor would be the  constructor for the project as that term is defined in the Occupational  Health and Safety Act (the ""Act""); and,   Whereas an employee of the constructor operating a grader on the project  struck and killed a pedestrian; and,  Whereas Sudbury was charged with offences under the Act as the  constructor and the employer; and,  Whereas after being acquitted at trial and on appeal, the Ontario Court of  Appeal, in a decision issued on April 23, 2021, found Sudbury to be liable  for contraventions of the Construction Regulations as an employer as it  employed quality control inspectors to monitor the quality of work on the  project from time-to-time; and,  Whereas the Supreme Court of Canada, in a decision issued on  November 10, 2023, was evenly divided 4-4 on the issue resulting in the  dismissal of Sudbury's appeal; and,        23  Whereas the consequence of this decision is that municipalities in Ontario,  as well as all other owners of property in the province, who wish to  undertake construction, are subject to being charged and convicted as an  employer for offences in relation to project sites for which they have no  control and have, in accordance with the Act, contracted with an entity to  assume oversight and authority over the work on such site as the  constructor; and,  Whereas the potential of an owner being charged as an employer as that  term is defined in the Act in circumstances where it has engaged a  constructor disregards and renders meaningless the owner-constructor  provisions contained in the Act and presents an unacceptable level of  increased risk and confusion for owners and contractors throughout the  province; and,  Whereas the Town of Whitby believes that the safety of workers is  paramount however the safety of workers on construction projects in  Ontario is not increased by placing liability on parties that do not have  control of and are not responsible for the conduct of the work on such  sites.   Now therefore be it resolved:  1. That Correspondence 2024-87 from A. Adams, Regional Clerk,  Regional Municipality of Peel, dated February 2, 2024 re Supreme  Court of Appeal in Sudbury v. Ontario (Ministry of Labour) be  endorsed by Council; and,  2. That the Council of The Town of Whitby requests that the province  amend the Occupational Health and Safety Act to clarify the  definition of ""employer"" to exclude owners that have contracted with  a constructor for a project; and,  3. That this resolution be provided to the Honourable Doug Ford,  Premier of Ontario, the Honourable David Piccini, Minister of  Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development, the  Honourable Paul Calandra, Minister of Municipal Affairs and  Housing, the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, the  Federation of Northern Ontario Municipalities, Mayors and Regional  Chairs of Ontario, the Council of Ontario Construction Associations,  the Ontario Chamber of Commerce and all Greater Toronto Area  municipalities.       24  Carried    9.6  LS 04-24, Legal and Enforcement Services Department Report  Re: Implementation of Administrative Penalty System for parking  infractions in Whitby & School Zone Parking Enforcement Update  See also Memorandum from A.

Carried    9.15 Removal of Tolls from Highway 407  Resolution # 60-24  Moved by Councillor Lundquist  Seconded by Councillor Lee  Whereas on February 15, 2024 the Province announced it will be  introducing new legislation through the Get It Done Act in the Legislature's  spring sitting, which if passed will prohibit Ontario from introducing new  tolls on provincial highways and potentially require public consultation  before considering new tolls; and,  Whereas Highway 407 East from Brock Road (Regional Road 1) in  Pickering to Highway 35/115 is provincially owned with tolls set by the  province; and,  Whereas if excluded from the proposed ban on tolls, Highway 407 East  would become the only tolled provincially owned highway in Ontario,  resulting in unfair economic impacts to Durham Region residents and  businesses; and,       32  Whereas planned Regional construction work to widen Winchester Road  (Regional Road 3) from Anderson Street to Baldwin Street (Regional  Highway 12) will necessitate reducing Winchester Road to one lane of  traffic in one direction over two construction seasons impacting travel  times for residents and businesses; and,  Whereas removal of tolls on Highway 407 East work would improve  overall travel times and alleviate the traffic impacts on surrounding  Regional and local municipal roads during the Winchester Road  construction.  Now therefore be it resolved:  1. That the Council of the Town of Whitby request the Province of  Ontario to amend the Get It Done Act to include the permanent  removal of road tolls on the existing Highway 407 East from Brock  Road in Pickering to Highway 35/115; and,  2.

The first ride took place in 2009, departing from Iroquois Park  Sports Complex in Whitby and ending in Trenton.

Once he had moved into the  new home, the original home on the property was retained in its original  state and used by family members when they came to visit.  He  expressed that it is not his intention to modify the ten acre property in  any way.  He made reference to a letter that was written to Council  expressing concerns that he may wish to sever the lot. He assured  Council that this is not his intention.  He will only use the original home  on the property to accommodate extended family.  Gary Polonsky appeared before Council and advised that he is not a  Whitby resident. He has lived in Courtice for twenty-five years, but would  like to relocate to Whitby.

Recommendation:  Moved by Councillor Yamada  Whereas municipalities face growing infrastructure needs, including  roads, bridges, public transit, water systems, and other critical  services, which are essential to community well-being and  economic development; and,  Whereas the current sources of municipal revenue, including  property taxes and user fees, are insufficient to meet these  increasing demands for infrastructure investment; and,  Whereas the Province of Ontario currently collects the Land  Transfer Tax (LTT) on property transactions in municipalities across  the province, generating significant revenue that is not directly  shared with municipalities; and,  Whereas the Federal Government collects the Goods and Services  Tax (GST) on property transactions, a portion of which could be  directed to municipalities to address local infrastructure needs; and,  Whereas redistributing a portion of the LTT and GST to  municipalities would provide a predictable and sustainable source  of funding for local infrastructure projects without creating a new tax  burden on residents or homebuyers; and,  Whereas a redistribution of a portion of the existing LTT and GST  would allow municipalities to better plan and invest in long-term  infrastructure initiatives, supporting local economic growth and  improving the quality of life for residents.       12  Now therefore, be it resolved:  1. That the Council of the Town of Whitby formally requests the  Provincial Government to consider redistributing a portion of  the Land Transfer Tax collected on property transactions to  municipalities; and,  2. That the Council of the Town of Whitby calls on the Federal  Government to allocate a percentage of the Goods and  Services Tax collected on property sales to municipalities;  and,  3. That this redistribution of the Land Transfer Tax and Goods  and Services Tax should be structured to provide predictable  and sustainable funding to municipalities, allowing for better  long-term planning and investment in infrastructure projects  that benefit local communities, thus ensuring that local  governments receive a fair share of the revenue to address  critical infrastructure needs; and,  4. That copies of this resolution be forwarded to Prime Minister  Justin Trudeau, Premier Doug Ford, the Ontario Minister of  Finance, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing,  Durham Region MPs and Durham Region MPPs; and,  5. That copies of this resolution be forwarded to the local  municipalities in Durham Region, the Region of Durham, the  Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM), and the  Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO) for their  endorsement and advocacy.  Carried later in the meeting. (See following motion)  Recommendation:  Moved by Councillor Mulcahy  The main motion be amended by including the following as Item 4  and that the remaining items be renumbered accordingly:    4. That the Province of Ontario consider AMO's advocacy focused  on the Housing Affordability Task Force recommendations,  advocating for long-term and predictable infrastructure funding, and  supporting on-going discussions around the importance of the       13  development charge regime in funding housing-enabling  infrastructure in many communities.  Carried  The main motion, as amended, was then carried as follows:  Recommendation:  Moved by Councillor Yamada  1. That the Council of the Town of Whitby formally requests the  Provincial Government to consider redistributing a portion of  the Land Transfer Tax collected on property transactions to  municipalities; and,  2. That the Council of the Town of Whitby calls on the Federal  Government to allocate a percentage of the Goods and  Services Tax collected on property sales to municipalities;  and,  3. That this redistribution of the Land Transfer Tax and Goods  and Services Tax should be structured to provide predictable  and sustainable funding to municipalities, allowing for better  long-term planning and investment in infrastructure projects  that benefit local communities, thus ensuring that local  governments receive a fair share of the revenue to address  critical infrastructure needs; and,  4. That the Province of Ontario consider AMO's advocacy  focused on the Housing Affordability Task Force  recommendations, advocating for long-term and predictable  infrastructure funding, and supporting on-going discussions  around the importance of the development charge regime in  funding housing-enabling infrastructure in many  communities; and,  5. That copies of this resolution be forwarded to Prime Minister  Justin Trudeau, Premier Doug Ford, the Ontario Minister of  Finance, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing,  Durham Region MPs and Durham Region MPPs; and,  6. That copies of this resolution be forwarded to the local  municipalities in Durham Region, the Region of Durham, the  Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM), and the       14  Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO) for their  endorsement and advocacy.  Carried    6.5.2 Reducing or Eliminating Tolls on Highway 407 East   Councillor Lee introduced a motion regarding reducing or  eliminating tolls on Highway 407 East.  Recommendation:  Moved by Councillor Lee  Whereas at a media appearance on October 25, 2024 Premier  Ford fielded a question regarding the possibility of reducing or  eliminating tolls on Highway 407 as an alternative to constructing a  tunnel under Highway 401; and,   Whereas in response to the question, Premier Ford indicated that  he has requested that the Minister of Transportation review  reducing or eliminating tolls on the provincially-owned portion of the  highway, being Highway 407 East; and,   Whereas Premier Ford further indicated that the Province would do  a feasibility study regarding reducing or eliminating tolls on  Highway 407 East and that any toll adjustments could be made  quickly; and,   Whereas the Get It Done Act, 2024 prohibits Ontario from  introducing tolls on provincial highways; and,  Whereas Highway 407 East is the only tolled provincially owned  highway in Ontario, resulting in unfair economic impacts to Durham  Region residents and businesses; and,  Whereas the Council of the Town of Whitby has previously  advocated for the removal of tolls on Highway 407 East through  Resolution # 60-24 adopted at the March 18, 2024 Regular Council  Meeting in order to boost economic development, improve travel  times, and alleviate traffic impacts in Durham Region.  Now therefore be it resolved:       15  1. That the Council of the Town of Whitby requests that the  Province of Ontario reduce or eliminate tolls on Highway 407  East from Brock Road in Pickering to Highway 35/115; and,  2. That the Mayor be requested on behalf of Council, to author  a letter including this motion to the Premier of Ontario, the  Minister of Transportation, all Durham Region MPPs, all  Durham municipalities, the City of Kawartha Lakes, the  Township of Cavan Monaghan, the City of Peterborough, the  Ontario Trucking Association, and the Ontario Federation of  Agriculture.

Committee identified the need to receive further legal advice regarding  Item 6.5.3, and thus moved in-camera for a second time in accordance  with the motion below.   Moved by Councillor Shahid  That Committee move in-camera in accordance with Procedure By-law #  8081-24, Closed Meeting Policy G 040, and the Municipal Act, 2001,  Section 239 (2)(f) advice that is subject to solicitor-client privilege,  including communications necessary for that purpose.

A question and answer period ensued with regard to the size of the  garage and the percentage of space that would be eliminated if the  reduced size were approved.

Mr.  Malone stated that the landowners group had previously asked for a  front-ending agreement that would see the costs of development charge  studies funded by the landowner group, however the report was  recommending that the landowners group fund seventy-five percent of  the studies resulting in no development charge credits.  He further  mentioned that this recommendation was a surprise to the landowners  group and that they had not had opportunity to negotiate this with Town  staff.  A detailed question and answer period ensued regarding the size of the  land mass that is involved in the Work Plan and it was noted that the  Brooklin Landowners control only forty percent of the land in comparison  to the Whitby landowners group that controls almost one hundred  percent of the land. The Brooklin landowners group are paying for  studies on lands that were not originally included in the plan when it was  created.  Detailed discussion ensued with respect to the Highway 407 Bypass  and whether it would be running through Brooklin.  It was noted that if  the bypass does run through Brooklin that it would be difficult to proceed  with the secondary plan and that land uses would be impacted.

Further discussion ensued noting that there seemed to be no reason  why the developer could not find a design that would accommodate the  garage size as stated in the by-law.  It was further noted that supporting  the application to reduce the size of the garage would be moving  backward from the new standards that have been implemented.

He noted that written  correspondence was submitted by the public regarding items on the agenda. Mr. Harris  advised that the Committee would receive delegations regarding Item 4.1, PL 10-20 and  Item 4.5, PL 28-20. He provided Members of Council with an overview of meeting  etiquette and procedures with respect to conducting the meeting electronically.    Page 1 of 17  Committee of the Whole Minutes   June 08, 2020 - 7:00 PM    Call to Order  Call of the Roll: The Clerk  Declarations of Pecuniary Interest      There were no declarations of pecuniary interest.      Planning and Development     Councillor Mulcahy assumed the Chair.  1.  Presentations    1.1  There were no presentations.    2.  Delegations    2.1  Terry Simzer, President, Durham Common Elements Condominium  Corporation No. 223  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 10-20  DEV-19-19, Draft Plan of Subdivision Application (SW-2019-01) and  Zoning By-law Amendment Application (Z-11-19), Madison Brooklin  Developments Ltd., South of Roybrook Avenue, East of Baldwin Street  South    Refer to Item 4.1, PL 10-20  Terry Simzer, President, Durham Common Elements Condominium  Corporation No. 223, 61 Tempo Way, addressed the Committee and  noted that he submitted written correspondence to the Town earlier in  the day. He advised that he met with the developer in October 2019  regarding his expectations and concerns. He stated that he understood  the rationale for the proposed pedestrian connection, but that it was not  an option for the community. He noted that the condominium corporation  owns and maintains the private roads in the existing development and  requested that Council recommend that the proposed development not  include a pedestrian access to the private property. Mr. Simzer raised  concerns regarding people trespassing, parking and drinking alcohol as  well as setting off fireworks in the cul-de-sac at the south end of Tempo  Way. He stated that this was a community safety issue and not a  pedestrian access issue, noting that there was no need for residents  living outside of the condominium corporation to have access to the  private property. He stated that including an additional access point to  Page 2 of 17  Committee of the Whole Minutes   June 08, 2020 - 7:00 PM    the private property should be a decision that is made by the  condominium corporation and not by the Town of Whitby. Mr. Simzer  advised that he received confirmation from the developer that the  proposed townhouses abutting the condominium property would be a  more traditional style and that they would not exceed two storeys in  height in order to conform to the height of the existing homes. He stated  that he understood and accepted that the townhouses located further  away from the property would be three storeys in height because they  would be far enough away that they would not create privacy issues for  existing residents. Mr. Simzer raised further concerns regarding traffic  flow, noting that the additional traffic resulting from the proposed  development would create more traffic and congestion. He expressed  concerns about the residents from the proposed development using the  private roads within the condominium corporation as a bypass to access  Chelmsford Drive. He stated that consideration would be given to  installing speed humps or other traffic calming measures should the use  of the private roads become an issue. Mr. Simzer stressed the  importance of the proposed parkette for the community, noting that he  would like it to be a large as possible. He requested that the parkette be  named in honour of Roy Ormiston. He further requested that when  naming streets within the new development, consideration be given to  using Balsam Brae and Starlite as street names to continue the custom  of using the names of Roy Ormiston's champion cattle. He commented  on Roy Ormiston's legacy having donated funding and land for a  hospital southwest of the Highway 407 interchange at Baldwin Street.      2.2  Billy Tung and Ryan Chin representing Madison Brooklin Developments  Ltd.  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 10-20  DEV-19-19, Draft Plan of Subdivision Application (SW-2019-01) and  Zoning By-law Amendment Application (Z-11-19), Madison Brooklin  Developments Ltd., South of Roybrook Avenue, East of Baldwin Street  South     Refer to Item 4.1, PL 10-20  Billy Tung and Christian Lamanna, representing Madison Brooklin  Developments Ltd., addressed the Committee and advised that they had  read and were in agreement with the Staff Report. Mr. Tung noted that  his team was working to address the concerns noted within the Staff  Report. He advised that his client had a discussion with Mr. Simzer  regarding reducing the height of the townhouses abutting the existing  development. He noted the concerns raised about the pedestrian  access form the proposed development to the existing development and  advised that this matter would be addressed through the site plan  Page 3 of 17  Committee of the Whole Minutes   June 08, 2020 - 7:00 PM    approval process. He indicated that the pedestrian access would  facilitate a more direct connection from the existing community to the  proposed parkette, but that the connection would require the  condominium corporation's agreement.  A question and answer period ensued between Mr. Tung, Mr. Lamanna  and Members of the Committee regarding:  • how the concerns regarding water problems in the area have  been resolved;  • confirmation on the height of the proposed buildings in the high  density block, and the timeline for the development of the  proposed high density block;  • whether there would be any opposition to leaving the holding  provision on the potential twelve-storey building;  • whether the apartment buildings would be condominiums or  rental units;   • confirmation that consultation would take place with the  condominium corporation regarding the pedestrian access;  • the loss of a connection to the easement along Highway 407 and  the parkette should the pedestrian access not take place;  • whether consideration was given to relocating the parkette further  away from Highway 407; and,  • the timeline for the development of the proposed Prestige  Employment Block and whether a holding provision would assist  with the requirement for a noise feasibility study prior to the  passing of an amendment to the Zoning By-law.      2.3  Brian Moss representing 840 Rossland Road Developments Ltd. (Ace  Developments Ltd.)   Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 28-20  Official Plan and Zoning By-law Amendment Applications, 840 Rossland  Road West, 840 Rossland Road Developments Ltd.

(Ace Developments Ltd.), addressed the Committee  and advised that he had read and was in support of the Staff Report. Mr.  Moss advised that the Public Meeting for the proposed development  took place in September 2019, noting that all studies have been  available for public viewing since that time. He further advised that a  community meeting was held in November 2019. He stated that of the  50 community members that were invited to the meeting 10 residents  were in attendance. He indicated that it was a productive meeting, but  Page 4 of 17  Committee of the Whole Minutes   June 08, 2020 - 7:00 PM    that there were no resolutions resulting from the community meeting. He  advised that following discussions with Town Staff revisions were made  to the proposal which included a reduction in the height of the building  along Rossland Road from 11 storeys to 6 storeys plus penthouse, and  re-positioning and reducing the length of the longest building on  Rossland Road to create more open space at the east end of Rossland  Road. Mr. Moss advised of concerns raised through recent  correspondence related to traffic issues for the area, specifically for the  development proposal located at 900 Rossland Road West. He further  advised that his client would grant an easement to 900 Rossland Road  West to facilitate access to the intersection of McQuay Boulevard and  Rossland Road.

Ms. McNabney advised  that she only became aware of the recommendation report being  presented at this meeting a week ago. She stated that she  understood that following the Public Meeting further meetings  would take place between residents and the developer to discuss  and respond to the various inquiries. She noted that there have not  been any further discussions and the concerns and questions have  not been answered. She stated that the proposed change to zoning  to permit an increase in the building height from three to four  storeys was not consistent with the Town's Official Plan or the  existing neighbourhood. She inquired about the type of proposed  housing, i.e., affordable, seniors or rental, where children from the  proposed development would attend school, whether a civil  infrastructure impact study was undertaken, and the sanitary sewer  capacity for the proposed development. She noted that an  environmental assessment should have been undertaken by a  neutral third party assessor. Ms. McNabney raised concerns about  shadowing, privacy, the increased traffic and traffic congestion,       3  providing adequate parking, the proposed chain-link fence, and the  grading of the site and potential water drainage/flooding of existing  properties. She expressed concerns about the proposed garbage  and snow storage area and asked whether it would be enclosed  and/or relocated to prevent snow melt and garbage from migrating  onto the existing residential properties. Ms. McNabney inquired  about the timeline for the commencement and completion of  construction, noting the impact of the construction noise for existing  residents and pets.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Ms. McNabney regarding:   whether there has been any communication between the  existing residents and the proponent since the Public  Meeting in 2019;   whether there were any changes to the proposed  development between 2019 and present; and,   how the delegate was notified about the Committee of the  Whole meeting and whether the notice indicated the  rationale for the change in the height of the building from  three to four storeys, and whether the delegate was aware of  whether other neighbours were notified of the meeting.  5.2.2 Carol Espie, Resident (In-Person Attendance)  Re: PDP 15-24, Planning and Development (Planning Services)  Department Report      Official Plan Amendment and Zoning By-law Amendment  Applications, Devon Downs Developments Ltd., 2002 Rossland  Road East, File Numbers: DEV-21-18 (OPA-2018-W/06, Z-33-18)  Refer to Item 5.4.2, PDP 15-24  Carol Espie, Resident, appeared before the Committee and  advised that her property would be impacted by the proposed  development. She stated that she has had several conversations  with Town Staff who provided detailed information about the  development plans. Ms. Espie advised that she now understood  that at the time she purchased her home in 1989, the details of the  plan presented to her for the proposed building was only a concept  and not an approved development. Ms. Espie advised that she       4  agreed with all of the concerns raised by the previous delegate.  She raised concerns about the six parking spaces that would be  located directly behind her property and approximately 10 feet from  her yard. She inquired about the grading of the development site,  noting that higher or lower grading would have an impact on her  property. Ms. Espie stated that the landscape plan currently  indicates that the snow storage area would be located directly  behind her property making it impossible for tree planting in that  area. She advised that she understood that a 6-foot wood privacy  fence as opposed to a chain link fence would be installed to prevent  any light trespass from vehicles in the parking area. Ms. Espie  expressed concerns about the responsibility of the maintenance of  the privacy fence, noting that it should not be the responsibility of  residents. She raised concerns about the size of the trees that  would be planted and requested that a more mature tree planting  take place.   A question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Ms. Espie regarding:   whether the delegate has had an opportunity to meet with  the developer; and,   whether the installation of the 6-foot fence and tree planting  was communicated to the delegate directly by the developer.  5.2.3 Lisa Klets, representing Devon Downs Developments Ltd. (In- Person Attendance)  Re: PDP 15-24, Planning and Development (Planning Services)  Department Report          Official Plan Amendment and Zoning By-law Amendment  Applications, Devon Downs Developments Ltd., 2002 Rossland  Road East, File Numbers: DEV-21-18 (OPA-2018-W/06, Z-33-18)    Refer to Item 5.4.2, PDP 15-24  Lisa Klets, representing Devon Downs Developments Ltd.,  appeared before the Committee and provided detailed information  about the rationale for the Official Plan and Zoning By-law  Amendment applications, and the proposed development and  public consultation. Ms. Klets stated that various revised and/or  updated submissions were provided to the Town, noting that the       5  Central Lake Ontario Conservation Authority has no objection to the  proposed development. She advised that submissions to the Town  address concerns about lighting, noise, the proximity to the airport,  increased traffic and traffic congestion, and watermain and sanitary  sewer services. She advised that the density and height of the  proposed development was in conformity with the Official Plan  designation, the Provincial Policy Statements and Growth Plans.  Ms. Klets stated that concerns related to privacy, noise, grading,  water drainage, and landscaping would be addressed through the  site plan review and approval process.    A detailed question and answer period ensued between Members  of Committee and Ms. Klets regarding:   whether any dialogue with the existing residents has taken  place since 2019, and confirmation that D.G. Biddle &  Associates and the developer would meet with the area  residents prior to the matter being considered at Council;   when the decision was made to increase the height of the  building from 3 to 4 storeys;   whether the developer has committed to the 6-foot wooden  fence and whether the fence could be higher;   the size of the tree plantings and whether more mature trees  could be planted;   confirmation that there would be a 3-metre buffer of  landscaping between the parking spaces and the fence, and  whether snow storage would be located within the 3-metre  buffer;   the lack of privacy for new and existing residents due to the  height of the building and the balconies;   whether the proposed development would have rental units,  if there were any plans to include housing for seniors, and  whether there was any intention to include affordable  housing units; and,   whether a shade study was undertaken.  5.3  Correspondence       6  There was no correspondence.  5.4  Staff Reports  5.4.1 PDP 14-24, Planning and Development (Planning Services)  Department Report  Re: Draft Plan of Condominium Application, 3425 Coronation  Developments Limited, Northeast Corner of Coronation Road and  Twin Streams Road, File Number: DEV-29-23 (CW-2023-05)  Recommendation:  Moved by Councillor Mulcahy  1.

Minutes of the 6th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment                   Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/41/21  Cedar City TFP Whitby  31 Torbay Court  An application has been received from Cedar City TFP Whitby, for a variance from the  provisions of By-law 1784.  The application is for permission to reduce the minimum required rear yard setback  from 7.5m to 3.0m.  The requested variance is required to permit the construction of a detached dwelling on  an irregular shaped lot.   In Support of Application  Richard Vink  In Opposition of Application  None at this time.  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.

At the deepest point, the rear yard setback is approximately 11.0m, and the requested  variance would only apply to a small area within the south portion of the rear yard.   R. Vink concluded that the variance is appropriate and meets the 4 tests as outlined in  the Planning Act.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee. There were none.

He provided the Committee members with a  presentation pamphlet containing information about the proposed development.   Minutes of the 7th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  M. Pettigrew provided an overview of the proposed development and the requested  variances. M. Pettigrew further expressed that in his opinion the variances meet the four  tests as prescribed under the Planning Act and agrees with the recommendations of the  Staff Report.  The Chair asked if there were any questions of the Committee.  B. O'Carroll asked the applicant what the small structure located at the north east part  of the site is for.  M. Pettigrew replied that this structure is an exhaust vent for the below grade parking  garage.  B. O'Carroll asked if the exhaust vent will expel odour?  M. Pettigrew replied not to his knowledge.  B. O'Carroll asked if there was enough planting located along the north west property  line for privacy screening.  M. Pettigrew replied yes. The landscape plan was recently approved by the Town of  Whitby.  J. Cardwell asked about the unit sizes proposed within the apartment building.  M. Pettigrew replied that there will be a mix of unit sizes. Most units will be one bedroom  suites, whereas approximately 25% of the total units provided will be made up of two  bedroom suites.  S. Haslam asked if there will be a passenger drop-off zone on the site.  M. Pettigrew replied that there will not be a dedicated layby or passenger drop-off zone,  but there will be sufficient room within the driveway to drop off or pick up individuals.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that no correspondence was received.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.  M. Wiles-Frost introduced herself to the Committee as the owner of 130 Pine Street.  She expressed that she was involved in the public consultation process for the original  site specific Zoning By-law Amendment in 2004.  M. Wiles-Frost noted that her primary concerns pertain to the location of the proposed  exhaust vent, traffic on Pine Street, and ground vibrations which will arise during the  building construction process.   Minutes of the 7th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  J. Taylor provided input to the ground vibration concern, and noted that developers  typically conduct a pre and post damage assessment for abutting properties.  The Chair invited the next member of the public to speak before the Committee.  J. Shingler introduced herself to the Committee as the owner of 125 Pine Street, and  her primary concerns relate to the Pine Street widening and ground vibrations.  J. Taylor replied that the road widening is a request from the Town and is common for  new developments. Although the Town will secure road widenings, it is unsure at this  time if a physical road widening will occur.  J. Shingler also expressed concern with the building height and was not supportive of  the proposed four storey structure across the street from her dwelling.  The Chair noted that the building height of seven and four storeys is permitted within the  Zoning By-law.  The Chair invited the next member of the public to speak before the Committee.  A. Glen introduced herself to the Committee as the owner of 117 Pine Street. She  expressed that the proposed development will take away from the community character,  and shares similar concerns as expressed by the previous speakers.  The Chair invited the next member of the public to speak before the Committee.  A. Glen introduced himself to the Committee as the owner of 117 Pine Street. He also  expressed that the proposed development will take away from the community character,  and shares similar concerns as expressed by the previous speakers.  The Chair invited the next member of the public to speak before the Committee.  E. Mueller introduced herself to the Committee as a concerned resident. She noted that  she does not reside close to the proposed development but would like clarification as to  how the proposed built form will tie into the surrounding neighbourhood.  M. Pettigrew provided a colored rendering of the development to E. Mueller and advised  her that the proposed building will include a contemporary style.  The Chair asked E. Mueller if she had a direct interest in the development.  E. Mueller replied no, but has concerns on behalf of the local residents.  The Chair noted that the proposed development received Site Plan Approval from  Council and the variances requested are not related to the buildings form.  B. O'Carroll noted that the apartment building use is currently permitted for seniors over  the age of 60. The applicant is now seeking relief from the Zoning By-law to remove the  age restriction for residents.   Minutes of the 7th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  The Chair invited the next member of the public to speak before the Committee.  N. Davey introduced himself to the Committee as the owner of 127 Pine Street. He  expressed that his primary concerns relay to increased traffic along Pine Street as well  as the contemporary architectural style of the proposed building.  The Chair clarified that the Committee does not have the power to regulate the  architectural style of buildings.  M. Pettigrew noted that a traffic impact study was prepared in 2017. The report  confirmed that the proposed development would not cause any adverse traffic impacts  along Pine Street.  The Chair invited the next member of the public to speak before the Committee.  E. Correll introduced herself to the Committee as the owner of 117 Hickory Street, and  has been a resident of the community for over 50 years. She also noted that she was  involved in the public consultation process for the original site specific Zoning By-law  Amendment in 2004.  E. Correll advised that her primary concerns relate to flooding within the proposed  underground parking structure due to the high water table and the size of the proposed  units (Variance #2).  J. Taylor replied that the Variance #2 is not related to unit sizes, but is a representation  of the lot size. Due to the road widenings required by the Town and Region, the  minimum required lot size based on the permitted 120 units can not be met.  E. Correll asked the applicant where access to the underground parking garage will be  provided from.  M. Pettigrew replied that the access to the underground parking garage will be provided  by a ramp connected to the main driveway.  The Chair invited the next member of the public to speak before the Committee.  J. Hendrikse introduced herself to the Committee as the owner of the property located  at 154 Pine Street. She expressed concern that the conversion from the seniors  apartment building to a standard apartment building will create additional traffic flows.  The Chair invited the next member of the public to speak before the Committee.  M. Lafontaine introduced himself to the Committee as a resident of 125 Pine Street. He  expressed concerns with the proposed 1.4m loading space setback to a residential  zone and also asked the Committee if the Pine Street widening will be taken from his  property.  J. Taylor replied that it is unknown when and if Pine Street will be widened. If a widening  was required, the Town has the authority to expropriate land.   Minutes of the 7th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  M. Lafontaine further noted that in its current state, Pine Street is too narrow and would  prefer that construction vehicles not park on the street. When larger vehicles park on  Pine Street, there is usually not enough room to maneuver around them.  Moved by: B.

O'Carroll asked if there were any comments from the public.    Minutes of the 10th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  J.

The application is for permission to (1) permit an accessory apartment within a linked  dwelling unit with a minimum 9.0m lot frontage; and (2) reduce the minimum required  front yard landscaped open space from 40% to 38%.  The subject property is located at 104 Bach Avenue and is zoned Residential (R3A*)  within the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  The requested variances are required to permit an accessory apartment within the  basement of the existing linked dwelling unit located on the subject property.   In Support of Application  Nishant Patel (Applicant)   In Opposition of Application  Brett Steele  Marion Clark (Email Correspondence)   Nesar Sadeque (Email Correspondence)  Fermen Andrew (Email Correspondence)  Dru Hardowar (Email Correspondence)  Jeremy Jones  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  N. Patel introduced himself to the Committee and provided an overview of the  requested variances.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  B. O'Carroll asked the applicant to confirm if an entrance from the garage to the  basement is proposed.   N. Patel replied that this was part of the original proposal, but he is now proposing  access to the basement apartment from the rear yard.  B. O'Carroll noted that the space within the interior side yard is very narrow, and access  to the rear yard may be difficult.   N. Patel replied that access to the rear yard will be from the 1.2m wide interior side  yard.    Minutes of the 10th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  B. O'Carroll asked the applicant how many vehicles he owns.  N. Patel replied 2.  B' O'Carroll stated that when she conducted a site visit, a vehicle was parked on the  boulevard, and this can not count towards a legal parking space.  N. Patel agreed. He noted that the driveway will be widened to accommodate an  additional legal parking space on the driveway, in addition to the space within the  garage.  The Chair asked if there were any further questions from the Committee. There were  none.  The Chair asked staff if the application was approved, is there certainty that the  basement apartment would become certainty.  J. Taylor replied that if the Committee approved the variances, the applicant would still  be required to apply for a building permit and building code compliance is required.  J. Taylor noted that the applicant would have to work with their designer and the Town  of Whitby Building Department to ensure the proposal meets the building code.  The Chair asked staff if this subdivision were to be constructed today, would more  recent site specific zoning permit accessory apartments in this style of built form.  J. Taylor replied that if this was a new subdivision with a new site specific Zoning By- law, the Town would be required to respect recent Provincial policy directives regarding  the accommodation of accessory apartment within all ground related dwelling units. This  is a matter that the Town will be reviewing through the Comprehensive Zoning By-law  review.  The Chair confirmed that this application is enforcing provincial policy directives, which  have yet to be incorporated into the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law.  J. Taylor replied yes.  The Chair noted that should the variance be approved, the applicant is still required to  obtain a successful building permit.  S. Haslam asked the applicant how many people reside in the dwelling.  The applicant replied just himself and his wife.  S. Haslam asked the applicant if his only intention is to rent out the basement.  The applicant replied yes. He noted that he may rent out the primary dwelling in the  future if required.   Minutes of the 10th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  S. Haslam asked the applicant if he can meet the minimum required number of parking  spaces.  The applicant replied yes. He noted that there will be a maximum of 3 vehicles at any  given time.  D. McCarroll asked how the parking will be configured.  The applicant stated that one car will be in the garage, and 2 addition spaces will be  located on the driveway, side by side.  J. Taylor noted that this configuration would comply with the minimum parking  requirements.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.  J. Jones introduced himself as a resident. He noted that the previous owner of the  applicant's property was operating an Airbnb. There were issues in the past with the  Airbnb and he was hoping that there would not be issues again in the future.  The applicant replied that he can not speak to the previous owner's activities. He stated  that he purchased the property to live in, but if he had to relocate he would consider  renting out the primary dwelling in addition to the basement apartment.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that 3 letters (email) were received, and had been  circulated to the Committee prior to the meeting. The main issues noted within the  correspondence related to past activities and parties which were associated with the  former Airbnb use.  B. O'Carroll asked the applicant if he is already renting out space within the dwelling.  The applicant replied no. He stated that he has family members temporarily living with  him.  Moved by: B. O'Carroll  That the application to (1) permit an accessory apartment within a linked dwelling unit  with a minimum 9.0m lot frontage; and (2) reduce the minimum required front yard  landscaped open space from 40% to 38% located at 104 Bach Ave be Granted subject  to the following conditions:  1. Stormwater shall not be directed onto abutting properties.  2. Site grading shall conform to the requirements of Public Works Department.  3. Ensure that all three (3) required parking spaces for the primary dwelling and  accessory apartment are contained within private property.

In Support of Application  Cade Davies (Applicant)     Stephanie Davies (Applicant)   In Opposition of Application  None at this time.  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  C. Davies introduced himself to the Committee as the owner of the subject property. He  noted that they are proposing a building addition to the rear of the dwelling. The existing  interior side yard setback of the dwelling is approximately 3.0m, however, the minimum  requirement is 4.5m. The proposed building addition will be an extension of the rear wall  of the existing dwelling and a continuation of the current 3.0m interior side yard setback  is proposed.   The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee. There were none.   The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that no public correspondence was received.   The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.  Moved by: B. O'Carroll   Minutes of the 10th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  That the application to reduce the minimum required interior side yard setback where no  garage or carport is provided on the lot from 4.3m to 3.0m located at 507 Kent Street be  Granted subject to the following conditions:  1. That the site grading and all other services conform to the requirements of the  Public Works Department.  2. Roof leaders from the proposed building extension shall not negatively impact  the adjacent property.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variance is  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.   Minutes of the 10th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/34/20  Lionel and Joyce Williams  4595 Country Lane  An application has been received from Lionel and Joyce Williams, for variances from  the provisions of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  The application is for permission to (1) increase the total combined lot coverage of all  accessory structures from 150.0 sq.m to 284.0 sq.m and (2) increase the maximum  permitted height of an accessory structure from 5.5m to 6.4m.  The subject property is located at 4595 Country Lane and is zoned Agriculture (A) within  the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  The requested variances are required to permit the construction of two detached  garages on the subject property.   In Support of Application  Lionel Williams (Applicant)  Joyce Williams (Applicant)  Matthew Richard (Resident)  In Opposition of Application  None at this time.  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  L. Williams introduced himself to the Committee. He stated that the increased height of  the proposed detached garages will enhance the character of the proposed detached  dwelling and increased area of the garages is required for the family's 7 vehicles, and  summer lawn maintenance and winter maintenance machinery.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  B. O'Carroll asked the applicant if there will be any connections from the garages to the  dwelling.  L. Williams replied no.  B. O'Carroll noted that with our climate most people prefer a covered connection from  their garage to the dwelling.   Minutes of the 10th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  J. Taylor advised the Committee that the Town of Whitby Planning staff have met on  multiple occasions with the applicant's designer, and it was found that there would be  grading issues and design issues if the applicant connected the two detached garages  to the dwelling. J. Taylor concluded that if the garages were attached to the dwelling  they would comply with the maximum building height and the requirement for both  variances would not be required.  The applicant decided to pursue the variances to  enhance the architectural element of the accessory structures and to respect the  grading on the site.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that the staff report was recommending deferral of the  application pending comments from the Central Lake Ontario Conservation Authority  (CLOCA). These comments were received prior to the meeting and CLOCA has no  objection to the variances subject to two conditions, which were circulated to the  Committee prior to the meeting.  J. Malfara confirmed that Planning staff are now recommending approval of the  requested variance.  The Chair asked if there were any further conditions from the Town.  J. Malfara replied no, and that standard grading and servicing review will be conducted  at the building permit stage.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that no public correspondence was received.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.  M. Richard introduced himself to the Committee as the owner of 4760 Country Lane. He  noted that he is in support of the requested variances.  Moved by: S. Haslam  That the application to (1) increase the maximum permitted area of accessory structures  from 150.0 sq.m to 284.0 sq.m and (2) increase the maximum permitted height of an  accessory structure from 5.5m to 6.4m located at 4595 Country Lane be Granted  subject to the following conditions:  1.

Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  J. Cardwell asked the applicant what will occur on                 the asphalt     area to be removed,        situated between     the proposed easterly boundary         of the     driveway and the existing  coniferous tree flanking Ontario Street W.            J. Taylor replied that       the applicant has       conveyed to staff       that permeable pavers     will be      installed within this       area, providing     a pathway     from the     Ontario Street W.       sidewalk to the        existing southerly building entrance.        The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara replied that a written          letter and verbal     communication was     received from      Marguerite Vorvis (416 King Street) expressing       interest in the      application and providing      opposition to any proposed driveway           access from King     Street.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.  R. McDonnell introduced himself     to the     Committee as a local resident who resides     at  600 King Street.      R. McDonnell expressed that he was concerned that             the proposal     entailed a driveway      leading from King Street; but, is at ease knowing                  that the parking area subject to this      application will utilise the existing driveway             on Ontario Street W.      R. McDonnell asked the Committee for confirmation that the             King Street façade of       the  subject property will not be           altered in the     future.  The Chair replied that the subject application being heard before the Committee  pertains to the requested variances as they apply to the existing driveway along Ontario  Street W, and not the facade of the existing building along King Street.  Moved by: J. Cardwell  That the application to:  1. exempt the subject property from provision 6A (1) which requires that one  parking space shall be provided in addition to the parking requirements of the  principle dwelling;  2. permit 2 required parking spaces to be located in the front yard, whereas Section  6A 3.4(a) requires one of the two required parking spaces for the single detached  dwelling to be located in either the side yard, rear yard or in a private garage or  carport;  3. exempt the subject property from provision 6A 3.4(b) which states that a  driveway shall provide direct access to a required parking space in either a side  yard, rear yard or in a private garage or carport;  Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment                                                                                                                                                                                                             4. exempt the subject property from provision 6A 3.4(d) which states that no more  than one required parking space shall be located on a driveway in a front yard or  exterior side yard; and  5. reduce the minimum width of a parking space from 2.75m to 2.60m for the lands  located at 418 King Street be GRANTED subject to the following condition:  That the site grading and all other services conform to the requirements of the Public  Works Department.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of               the opinion that       the variances     are  minor in    nature, that     the general intent and       purpose of the       By-law and the      Official Plan is being        maintained, and that       the granting of the     application is     desirable and would       result in the appropriate        development of     the property.    The contents of the staff report, and all written and oral submissions were considered  and had an effect on the Committee's decision.

This application was previously tabled at the February 8, 2018 meeting. This  application has since been amended to include an additional variance (No. 4) as it  relates to the minimum number of parking spaces to be provided on the subject  property.  The application is for permission to:  1.  reduce the minimum dwelling unit area from 56 square metres to 48 square metres; 2.  exempt the subject property from part of provision 25(107)(c) which requires that  one (1) temporary parking space shall be located at or near the southerly  entrance of the buildings; 3.  to reduce the minimum side yard setback to a parking area from 1.9 metres to  1.0 metre; and 4.  reduce the minimum required parking spaces to 1.15 spaces per dwelling unit  plus 0.20 spaces per dwelling unit dedicated for visitors parking. The subject property is located at 840 Dundas St E. and is zoned R5 (Residential  Type 5 Zone), subject to a site specific zoning exception (provision 25(107)(c)) in  Zoning By-law 2585.  In Support of Application  Jules Paolozza (Agent)  In Opposition of Application  None at this time.  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  J. Paolozza introduced himself to the Committee as             the applicant and     advised the      Committee that since the application was             tabled at the     February 8, 2018     meeting, the      Site Plan has been revised to address comments                 provided by CLOCA.     In addressing  the CLOCA comments, the minimum number of parking               spaces on the       property can     not  be met,     and thus a parking analysis was conducted to                justify the proposed     reduction in  required parking spaces on the subject             property.  The Chair asked the applicant how the parking analysis was conducted.  J. Paolozza replied that his staff attended the             site during peak     parking hours (6pm –  7pm) to count the number of             parked cars (resident       and visitor) as     well as the total      number of surplus       parking spaces over       the duration of       the past 7    days.  Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment                                                                                                                                             The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  S. Haslam asked the applicant if the            recently conducted parking analysis     was forwarded      to the Towns Engineering Department       for review.    J. Taylor replied that       the parking analysis was not forwarded to               staff prior     to the      meeting. However, staff       have conducted their own site           visit and can     confirm that a    large  surplus of parking     spaces was observed.      S. Haslam asked staff       what is to occur on         the lands     identified as     part of the     flood plain      by the Conservation       Authority.  J. Taylor replied to the Committee that these lands located                   at the     north west     corner of  the subject property will remain       as a vacant asphalt        surface with no parking       located  within.  J. Cardwell asked the applicant if they consulted              with the     Public Works Department      regarding the     parking analysis.  J. Taylor replied that       this has not       been done as the parking analysis           was completed     just  prior to this meeting.        The Chair asked Staff if the parking analysis completed by the applicant was  acceptable.  J. Taylor replied that       Planning Staff are satisfied with           the findings     of the applicants  parking analysis.  B. O'Carroll asked the applicant if the garbage bins            as illustrated on the       Site Plan will  remain in the      shown location.    J. Paolozza replied yes.     The proposed location     for the     garbage bins at     the rear     of the      property is required to        facilitate safe and unobstructed         access for collection       vehicles.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J.

Declarations of Pecuniary Interest    1.1  Mayor Mitchell declared a pecuniary interest under the Municipal  Conflict of Interest Act regarding any discussion pertaining to the  proposed hospital site in North Whitby as well as the mid-block arterial  road, as Mayor Mitchell and his family have an interest in 5455 Ashburn  Road, which is a part of the proposed hospital site and the mid-arterial  road.     2.  Public Meeting - 2020 Operating and Capital Budget  Councillor Lee, Chair of Finance, provided an overview of the format of the public  meeting to members of the audience.     Special Council Minutes   February 18, 2020 - 7:00 PM    2.1  Presentation - 2020 Budget Overview  M. Gaskell, Chief Administrative Officer and K. Nix, Commissioner of  Corporate Services/Treasurer  M. Gaskell, Chief Administrative Officer and K. Nix, Commissioner of  Corporate Services/Treasurer provided an overview of the proposed  2020 Budget. Key highlights of the presentation included:   • A high-level overview of the 2020 Budget including key capital  and operating expenditures, their rationale, inflationary pressures  on the Town and how they will be mitigated;   • Investing in the Town's assets such as infrastructure, parks and  community spaces to ensure that they are in good working order  for current and future generations;   • Maintaining a good quality of life, which Whitby is known for,  while valuing fiscal responsibility and ensuring that the Town  plans ahead for future growth;   • Managing growth and its impact on tax revenues and expenses;   • Overview of the impact of the 2020 Budget on Whitby  households, in particular the property tax rate;   • How property taxes will be used to fund services;  • The challenges related to managing competing priorities of  taxpayer affordability, service delivery and growth, especially  when Whitby is experiencing unprecedented growth of 40% in the  next 12 years; and  • Ensuring robust economic development while addressing climate  change.       2.2  Delegations   Michael Baker, 10 Southshore Street, provided a delegation with respect  to the lack of community engagement during various stages of the  budget planning process. He advised that instead of soliciting  stakeholder feedback at the final phase of the budget process, the Town  should be engaging citizens at all stages, from inception to finalization,  so that they are involved and have opportunity to provide input. He  further suggested that the Town create an ""introductory course"" which  educates residents on how to read the budget, and understand its  components. He advised that the amount of community engagement  with respect to the budget was insufficient, and the Town and councillors  should work together to conduct Town Halls within each ward so that  residents have an opportunity to discuss the budget and voice their  opinion to Council members.   A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Council and Mr. Baker, and questions related to items the delegate had  Page 2 of 7  Special Council Minutes   February 18, 2020 - 7:00 PM    raised were directed to staff. These included:   • Current community engagement opportunities for the Budget and  how they were managed by the Town;   • Opportunities for enhancing engagement with residents through  Councillor Town Halls and how those types of activities can be  managed within the current budget;   • Touch-points within the Budget process where residents could be  engaged;  and  • Limitations on Council Members' budgets as per the Council  Expense Policy and how that can result in less engagement.   Karey Anne Large, Executive Director of the Downtown Whitby  Business Improvement Area (BIA), provided a delegation supporting the  BIA's ask of $10,000 in kind, which is a part of the 2020 proposed  budget. She provided an overview of the growth that the BIA has  undergone since its inception, rising costs due to increased event  planning for signature events and opportunities for cost savings for  future events. She requested that Council accept the BIA's request for  $10,000 in kind so that they may continue to hone their event strategy  and provide sustainable, signature events for the downtown.   A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Council and Ms. Large with respect to the Open Streets event and its  impact on future downtown events.   Paul Kneebone, 101 Fallingbrook Street, advised that his tax bill had  gone up significantly in the past few years. He questioned why growth in  the Town of Whitby was a positive thing, why was it necessary and what  percentage of his taxes would he be personally benefiting from, in terms  of services provided. He asked why current taxpayers were having to  pay for future growth, and whether it was possible to see more of an  analysis of cost saving measures in the budget. He further questioned  the lack of commercial growth versus residential growth in Whitby, and  the implications for residential taxpayers as a result. He also advised  that he had received limited communication from his councillor and  would like to see more engagement digitally.   A question and answer period ensued between Mr. Kneebone and  Members of Council with respect to:   • The impact of tax increases and reassessment to Mr. Kneebone's  total tax bill over the last five years;   • The impact of residential growth versus commercial growth and  its impact on residents;   • The limitations of Council Members to organize Town Halls on a  regular basis; and  • The various factors that drive population growth in Whitby.   Page 3 of 7  Special Council Minutes   February 18, 2020 - 7:00 PM    Ron Lalonde, 12 Winterberry Drive, provided an overview of rate  increases to his personal tax bill over the last few years, advising that  the increase on the Town's portion was higher than the Region and  education component. He expressed concern regarding the rate of  increase to Whitby property taxes, and advised that in the private sector,  such increases would not be accepted. He questioned why Whitby  taxpayers were paying for future growth and whether development  charges could offset some of the taxpayer burden.   A brief question and answer period ensued between Mr. Lalonde and  Members of Council with respect to the percentage increase on his tax  bill. Questions raised by the delegate regarding MPAC reassessment,  development charges paying for future growth and past property taxes  were directed to Staff.   Eric Ireland, 25 Rothean Drive, advised that he was frustrated with the  increase to his property tax bill over past years. He further expressed  disappointment at the lack of dialogue regarding a zero percentage  increase to the 2020 budget, or possibly even a negative increase, and  the implications to the Town. He advised that an increase to property  taxes was difficult for residents whose salaries were not increasing at  the same rate. He asked the Town to consider a zero percentage  increase, and work with the Province and the Federal Government to  reduce tax increases at those levels as well.   A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Council and Staff with respect to the implications on Town services of a  zero percentage increase to the budget.   Andrew Vahey, 5 Gainsbrook Court, advised that the lack of  communication regarding budget deliberations was concerning, and  questioned whether the budget was considering increased  communication costs. He advised that the Town had a responsibility to  engage with residents, at least electronically, so that they could be  apprised of Town matters such as the 2020 Budget. He expressed  concern at the current state of communications and how that would be  affected when there was more growth in the Town, and an increased  burden on resources. He asked the Town to increase investment in web  access and communication now, so that future residents would also  benefit from that.   A brief question and answer period ensued between Mr. Vahey and  Members of Council with respect to the types of communication that  residents would find helpful.   Norm Sawula, 6 Lacey Drive, provided an overview of the increase to  Page 4 of 7  Special Council Minutes   February 18, 2020 - 7:00 PM    his tax bill over the past few years, and advised that it was a lot of  money to pay for future growth. He asked if Town Staff could work with  MPP Lorne Coe to lobby the Provincial Government to increase  development charges so that some of taxpayer burden could be offset  by developers. He asked if there were other ways to fund growth as  opposed to property taxes, and whether the Town could find more  efficiencies than what was indicated in the proposed budget.   A brief question and answer period ensued between Mr. Sawula and  Members of Council, and questions regarding items raised by the  delegate were directed to Staff, including the factors driving tax  increases.   It was the consensus of Council to take a recess at 8:55 p.m. Council  reconvened at 9:09 p.m.  A detailed question and answer period ensued with respect to:   • How much of the budget would be allocated for future growth  versus current expenditures;   • Reasoning for increased growth to the Town of Whitby and its  associated costs;   • Residential growth versus corporate growth and how that is  addressed through the budget;   • Potential to raise funds through means other than property tax  increases, especially for future growth;   • Whether software upgrades or capital costs for software could be  included in development charges;   • The costs to maintain current services versus increasing service  levels;   • The implications of having a zero percentage increase on Town  services, including loss of service, reduced hours and lay-offs;   • Budgetary pressures and inflationary increases to the budget;   • How increased community engagement from the Town as well as  Council was addressed in the budget;   • How the additional positions requested in the budget would allow  Council Members to communicate more with their constituents,  including Town Halls, community meetings, etc.;   • How the proposed new staff positions would add value to the  Town;   • Ranking the proposed positions from most critical to least critical  so Council could determine which positions would add the most  benefit to the Town;   • Total costs related to the proposed positions;   • Expectations from residents on community engagement and  communication;   Page 5 of 7  Special Council Minutes   February 18, 2020 - 7:00 PM    • Whether the public can be engaged at different phases of budget  preparation as opposed to the final stage when it is presented;   • Implications of Bill 108;   • How reserve funds are used by the Town;   • Tax increases in previous years and how they have impacted the  current ask in the proposed budget;   • Impact of climate change to the need for certain staff positions,  and how that would be addressed in future staffing plans;   • Timelines for increased parking in the Whitby Downtown and how  that would be addressed;   • Details regarding Cullen Park redevelopment, and how the  Town's park assets would be maintained;   • The potential regionalization of the Fire Department and whether  that would be happening in the near future; and  • Asset Management and Asset Growth in the next few years.     3.

Eileen Costello provided a PowerPoint presentation regarding 7143  Ashburn Road and the request for de-designation of the structure.  Highlights of the presentation included:  • the reasons behind the request, including the diminished heritage  integrity of the site due to substantial alterations of the building  and the inconsistency with the planned development of the site in  relation to the Brooklin Secondary Plan; and,  • the preliminary subdivision development proposal.  Emma Abramowicz provided an overview of the heritage integrity of the  current structure which included:  • the diminished integrity in conveying the physical features related  to the heritage designation;  • improper management and stewardship of a heritage resource;  • the best strategy for communicating the agricultural heritage of  historic farmsteads; and,  Page 2 of 7  Heritage Whitby Advisory Committee Minutes   June 09, 2020 - 7:00 PM    • using on-site interpretation such as art pieces with agricultural  themes, installing community garden plots, design features such  as a park pavillion, and commemorating the Matthewsons' family  history throughout the public realm.

Committee of Adjustment-28 Feb 2019.pdf	Committee of Adjustment	2019-02-28	Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of the  Committee of Adjustment    Meeting Date:   Thursday February 28, 2019  Meeting Time:  7:00 p.m.  Meeting Location:  Whitby Municipal Building  575 Rossland Road East, Committee Room 1  Present:  S. Haslam, Chair   J. Cardwell  D. McCarroll  N. Chornobay  J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer  J. Taylor, Manager of Planning Administration   Item 1:  Disclosure of Interest:  There was no disclosure of interest by the members of the Committee of  Adjustment  Carried  Item 2:  Amendment to Public Hearing Order:  Moved by:  N. Chornobay  That application A/15/19 be moved to the end of the public meeting order.   Carried   Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   Item 3:  Public Hearings  A/12/19  Toni Stojanovic  21 Dymond Drive  An application has been received from Toni Stojanovic for a variance from the  provisions of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-Law 1784.  The application is for permission to reduce the minimum setback from a driveway to a  side lot line from 0.6m to 0.2m.   The requested variance is required to permit the widening of an existing driveway  located on the subject property.  The subject property is located at 21 Dymond Drive and is zoned Second Density  Residential (R2) in Zoning By-law 1784.  In Support of Application  Toni Stojanovic (owner)  In Opposition of Application  None at this time.  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  T. Stojanovic introduced himself to the Committee as the owner of the subject property.  He advised the Committee that the dwelling located on the property was recently  constructed, and is nearing completion. The variance requested is to permit the  widening of the existing driveway. The applicant noted that the increase to the driveway  width is not required for parking, but, for better aesthetics.   T. Stojanovic  noted that he read the Planning Staff Report. He also provided the  Committee with a letter written by Tony Gattellaro, the owner of the neighbouring  property to the east (17 Dymond Drive). T. Gattellaro expressed in his letter that he  would be satisfied with a 0.3m driveway setback instead of the 0.2m setback as  requested by T. Stojanovic .  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.   D. McCarroll asked the applicant why the home was not sited further to the west when it  was recently constructed. This would have allowed him to comply with the required  driveway setback to the interior lot line, and have a wider driveway as desired.   T. Stojanovic  replied that there is existing vegetation on the west side of the property  that he wanted to preserve.   Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   N. Chornobay asked the applicant if the driveway is constructed now as illustrated on  the site plan.   T. Stojanovic  replied no. The driveway is currently gravel.  N. Chornobay asked what the current width of the driveway is.   T. Stojanovic  replied that the driveway is approximately 5.9m in width.   N. Chornobay noted that the variance as requested would allow the driveway to be  widened by approximately 14 inches.   T. Stojanovic  replied yes.   N. Chornobay advised the applicant that he noticed large snow piles on the sides of the  driveway. He asked how the requested setback reduction will affect snow storage.   T. Stojanovic  replied that there will be no impact on snow storage.   N. Chornobay asked how the variance if approved would allow for better aesthetics.   T. Stojanovic  replied that the driveway currently has a jog towards the east property  line as it approaches the dwelling. The variance would permit the driveway to be parallel  to the abutting lot line, spanning from the rear yard detached garage to the street line.   N. Chornobay asked the applicant what prompted him to apply for a minor variance.   T. Stojanovic  replied that he understands the Zoning By-law and wanted to seek the  necessary approvals before he constructed the driveway.  The Chair asked the applicant if he was aware that the Staff Report was not in support  of his requested variance. He further noted that there is no hardship demonstrated.   T. Stojanovic  replied that he read the Staff Report, and was unaware that a hardship  had to be demonstrated.   The Chair asked the applicant why he can't comply with the Zoning By-law  requirements.   T. Stojanovic  replied that the driveway would look too narrow if he complied with the  required setback provisions.   J. Cardwell asked the applicant if the variance was amended to permit a minimum  setback of 0.3m from a driveway to a side lot line, what the driveway width would be.  J. Taylor advised the Committee that the width of the driveway would be approximately  6.5m.  The Chair asked the Committee if there were any further questions. There was none.   Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that no correspondence was received other than the  letter that was handed out by the applicant tonight from his neighbour.   The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.  N. Chornobay brought forward a motion that the application be approved as modified to  reduce the minimum setback from a driveway to a side lot line from 0.6m to 0.3m.  Moved by: N. Chornobay  That the application as amended to reduce the minimum setback from a driveway to a  side lot line from 0.6m to 0.3m located at 21 Dymond Drive be Granted subject to the  following condition:  1. That the site grading and all other services conform to the requirements of the Public  Works Department.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variance is  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report, oral submissions,  and written submission had an effect on the Committee's decision.   Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   Item 3:  Public Hearings  A/13/19  1652 Tricont GP Inc. (Christina Basan)  1652 Tricont Avenue  An application has been received from 1652 Tricont GP Inc. (Christina Basan) for a  variance from the provisions of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-Law 1784.  The application is for permission to increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from  50% to 51%.  The requested variance is required to permit the development of two industrial buildings  located on the subject property in accordance with Site Plan Application (SP-15-18).  The subject property is located at 1652 Tricont Avenue and is zoned Restricted  Industrial (M1) within Zoning By-law 1784.   In Support of Application  Lorelei Jones (Consultant)  In Opposition of Application  None at this time.  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  L. Jones introduced herself to the Committee as the Planner retained by the owners of  the subject property. She indicated that this property was subject to a minor variance  application in September 2018. She noted that the requested variance is required to  permit increased lot coverage, which was a result of minor amendments to the site  design in order to accommodate an internal garbage room within the buildings.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee. There were none.   The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.   J. Malfara advised the Committee that no correspondence was received.   The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.   Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   Moved by: J. Cardwell  That the application to increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 50% to 51%  located at 1652 Tricont Avenue be Granted subject to the following condition:  1. That all Public Works requirements related to Site Plan Application (SP-15-18) are  complied with.   Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variance is  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.   Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   Item 3:  Public Hearings  A/14/19  Baif Developments Ltd. (Paul Minz)  114 Deverell Street  An application has been received from Baif Developments Ltd. (Paul Minz) for variances  from the provisions of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-Law 1784.  The application is for permission to: (1) reduce the minimum required front yard setback  from 6.0m to 3.5m, (2) reduce the minimum interior side yard setback to a second  storey from 1.75m to 1.4m, (3) increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 33%  to 36.5%, and (4) increase the maximum permitted building height from 8.0m to 8.5m.  The requested variances are required to permit a single detached, two storey dwelling  on the subject property.   The subject property is located at 114 Deverell Street and is zoned Single Family  Detached Dwelling House (R2A) within Zoning By-law 1784.  In Support of Application  Lynn Barkey (Applicant)  In Opposition of Application  None at this time.  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  L. Barkey introduced himself to the Committee. He noted that he read the Planning Staff  Report and was pleased with the conclusions. He expressed that his company  developed the lands to the west of the property in the mid 1980's. The subject property  at this time fronts upon a temporary turning circle. Once the Minto development to the  east is completed and Deverell Street is extended eastward, the temporary turning  circle will be removed, and land will be dedicated back to the flanking properties to the  north and south.   L. Barkey noted that because of the temporary turning circle, the proposed dwelling can  not comply with the minimum required front yard setback. Once the turning circle is  removed and land is conveyed back to the abutting property, the front yard setback will  exceed the minimum requirement.   L. Barkey also noted that a variance is required to increase the maximum permitted  building height. He stated that the requested height is appropriate and provides a  desirable transition from the existing dwellings to the west and the proposed  contemporary dwellings to the east.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.    Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   D. McCarroll asked the applicant if he had any concept elevation drawings of the  proposed dwelling.   L. Barkey replied that he did not have any drawings available.   The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that no public correspondence was received.   The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.  Moved by: D. McCarroll  That the application to (1) reduce the minimum required front yard setback from 6.0m to  3.5m, (2) reduce the minimum interior side yard setback to a second storey from 1.75m  to 1.4m, (3) increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 33% to 36.5%, and (4)  increase the maximum permitted building height from 8.0m to 8.5m located at 114  Deverell Street be Granted subject to the following conditions:  1. That the site grading and all other services conform to the requirements of the Public  Works Department; and  2. Roof drainage from the proposed structure shall not impact the adjacent properties.   Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variances are  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.   Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   Item 3:  Public Hearings  A/16/19  Matthew Grice  10 Price Street  An application has been received from Matthew Grice for variances from the provisions  of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-Law 1784.  The application is for permission to: (1) permit a building addition within a (H) Holding  Zone, and (2) increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 20% to 22%.  The requested variances are required to permit the development of a single storey rear  yard building addition to the existing dwelling.  The subject property is located at 10 Price Street and is zoned Residential Type 2 –  Village of Brooklin Zone, and also subject to a Holding (H) provision (H-R2-VB), within  Zoning By-law 1784.  In Support of Application  Courtney Grice (Owner)  In Opposition of Application  None at this time.  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  C. Grice introduced herself to the Committee as the owner of the subject property. The  requested variances are required to permit a building addition in the rear yard of the  property.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.   D. McCarroll asked the applicant if the garage as illustrated on the submitted Site Plan  is already constructed.   C. Grice replied yes, and that the garage was recently constructed.   N. Chornobay advised the applicant that although the property is illustrated as a  rectangular shape on the submitted Site Plan, the property is in fact skewed (angled) at  the rear.  C. Grice replied that she was unaware of this discrepancy.   The Chair asked if there were any other questions from the Committee. There were  none.      The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.   Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   J. Malfara advised the Committee that no correspondence was received.   The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.  Moved by: J. Cardwell  That the application to (1) permit a building addition within a (H) Holding Zone, and (2)  increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 20% to 22% located at 10 Price  Street be Granted subject to the following conditions:  1. That the site grading and all other services conform to the requirements of the Public  Works Department; and  2. Roof drainage from the proposed structure shall not be directed onto the adjacent  property.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variances are  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.   Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   Item 3:  Public Hearings  A/17/19  Tom Koukidis  405 Cochrane Street (Part 1)  An application has been received from Tom Koukidis for variances from the provisions  of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-Law 2585.  The application is for permission to: (1) increase the maximum permitted building height  from 8.5m to 9.5m, (2) reduce the minimum required interior side yard setback to the  second storey of the dwelling from 2.0m to 1.2m, and (3) increase the maximum  permitted lot coverage from 35% to 39%.  The requested variances are required to permit the development of a new two storey  detached dwelling on the subject property.  The subject property is located at 405 Cochrane Street and is zoned Residential Type 2  (R2) within Zoning By-law 2585.   In Support of Application  John Koukidis (Agent)    Tom Koukidis (Owner)  In Opposition of Application  Peter McCormack    Glenys Davies    Ryan Liebregts  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  J. Koukidis introduced himself to the Committee. He read the Planning Staff Report and  agreed with the recommendation to reduce the maximum permitted building height from  the requested 9.5m to 9.0m.   The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.   D. McCarroll asked what the lot size is.   J. Koukidis replied that the property will be severed into two parcels, each parcel  measuring 50 feet by 150 feet.   N. Chornobay asked the applicant if the severance is final and binding.  J. Koukidis replied that the severance was approved by the Region of Durham, however  they were unable to clear the approval conditions within the 1 year timeline. As a result,  the severance approval lapsed and they are now proceeding through the severance  process again.   Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   The Chair noted that the Committee may seek to include a condition that associates the  variance application to a successful land division application at the Region of Durham if  the Committee of Adjustment application is recommended for approval.  D. McCarroll noted that the south elevation of the proposed dwelling only has one  window on the second storey.   J. Koukidis confirmed this.   D. McCarroll expressed concern that the abutting homes (fronting onto Beech Street)  backing onto the interior side yard of the applicant's property will be impacted by a blank  façade.  J. Taylor noted that enforcing the location of windows on the façade of a dwelling is  difficult from a planning perspective and is regulated by the Ontario Building Code.  N. Chornobay asked if there is a requirement for a fence to be installed along the  interior side lot line.   J. Taylor replied no.   J. Cardwell asked if the proposed glazing on the south façade of the dwelling complies  with the requirements of the Ontario Building Code.  J. Koukidis replied yes.   J. Taylor replied that a building permit can not be issued without compliance with the  Ontario Building Code.   The Chair asked if there were any other comments from the Committee. There were  none.   The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that no correspondence was received.   The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.   P. McCormack introduced himself to the Committee as a representative of the owners  of 808 Beech Street West. He advised the Committee that the applicants proposed  dwellings will have a negative impact on the abutting Beech Street W properties,  specifically the owner's privacy and enjoyment of their rear yards.   P. McCormack also noted that the height of the proposed dwellings is too high, there  will be an increase in traffic, and that applicant should plant trees along the south  property line to limit privacy impacts on the abutting properties. He also talked about the  location of lighting on the proposed dwelling as well.   Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   N. Chornobay asked P. McCormack to confirm that he is speaking to the Committee on  behalf of the owners of 808 Beech Street W.   P. McCormack replied yes.   N. Chornobay asked P. McCormack if he objects to the proposed building height and  interior side yard setback.  P. McCormack replied yes.   N. Chornobay noted that the Planning Staff Report recommends that the requested  maximum permitted building height is reduced from 9.5m to 9.0m.   The Chair expressed that the By-law already permits a 1.2m interior side yard setback  to the first storey of the dwelling.   N. Chornobay noted that the applicants requested variance to the interior side yard  setback to the second storey would allow them to construct the second storey flush with  the first storey.   J. Cardwell asked if a two storey dwelling is permitted on the property.   J. Taylor replied yes.   The Chair asked if there was anyone else from the public that wished to speak to the  application.   G. Davies introduced herself to the Committee as the owner of 808 Beech Street W.  She expressed to the Committee that windows should not be permitted on the south  facing exterior wall of the dwelling and that the height of the dwelling will have privacy  impacts on her property.    J. Cardwell noted that a two storey dwelling can be constructed within 2.0m of the south  property line, while complying with the provisions of the Zoning By-law.   J. Taylor further noted that the existing dwellings on Beech Street W are permitted to be  2 storeys in height.  G. Davies stated that no exterior lighting should be affixed to the south façade of the  proposed dwelling, as light would shine onto their property. Although the applicant's  property is currently vacant, the property to the north (409 Cochrane Street) has exterior  lights on the house, and she is impacted by them as well.  J. Taylor asked the G. Davies if she was referencing soffit lights?   G. Davies replied yes.   J. Taylor noted that it is difficult to regulate exterior lighting and it is beyond the powers  of the Committee of Adjustment to do so. With respect to fences, the applicant can not   Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   remove an existing shared fence without permission from the neighbouring owners. If  the applicant would like to construct a new fence, they can do so on their own property.  G. Davies stated that she and her neighbours do not want to see any windows on the  south facing wall of the applicants proposed dwelling.   J. Taylor noted that the location of windows is difficult to regulate from a planning  perspective.   J. Cardwell noted that the applicant must maintain a certain percentage of glazing on  the exterior of the building to comply with the Building Code.  G. Davies also stated that she does not want the proposed dwelling to be a rental unit.   J. Cardwell stated that the Committee can not restrict this from occurring.  D. McCarroll noted that the applicant can rent out the dwelling or have an accessory  apartment if they comply with the requirements of the Planning and Building  Departments.  The Chair asked if there were any other members of the public that wished to speak to  the application.   R. Liebregts introduced himself to the Committee as the owner of the neighbouring  property located at 409 Cochrane Street. He stated that the minimum required interior  side yard setback would allow for decreased privacy and light in the interior side yard.  He also sought confirmation on what the proposed height of the dwelling will be.   J. Taylor replied that Planning staff are recommending that the variance with respect to  height be reduced from 9.5m to 9.0m.  The maximum permitted building height as of  right is 8.5m.  R. Liebregts asked if the 9.5m is still proposed.   J. Taylor replied that the Committee would be required to make a motion to amend the  variance to reduce the building height to 9.0m.  G. Davies asked when construction is set to occur.   J. Taylor replied that this is up to the applicant; however, the applicant must proceed  through the severance process with the Region of Durham.   The Chair asked if there were any other members of the public who wished to speak to  the application. There was no one.  N. Chornobay proposed that Variance #1 regarding the maximum permitted building  height be reduced from 9.5m to 9.0, and to include a condition that the applicant  receives a successful land division (severance) from the Region of Durham.   Moved by: N. Chornobay   Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   That the application to (1) increase the maximum permitted building height from 8.5m to  9.0m (as amended), (2) reduce the minimum required interior side yard setback to the  second storey of the dwelling from 2.0m to 1.2m, and (3) increase the maximum  permitted lot coverage from 35% to 39% located at 405 Cochrane Street (Part 1) be  Granted subject to the following conditions:  1. That the site grading and all other services conform to the requirements of the Public  Works Department;  2. Roof drainage from the proposed structure shall not be directed onto the adjacent  property; and  3. The applicant receives a successful land division (severance) from the Region of  Durham that is final and binding.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variances are  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.   Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   Item 3:  Public Hearings  A/18/19  Tom Koukidis  405 Cochrane Street (Part 2)  An application has been received from Tom Koukidis for variances from the provisions  of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-Law 2585.  The application is for permission to: (1) increase the maximum permitted building height  from 8.5m to 9.5m, (2) reduce the minimum required interior side yard setback to the  second storey of the dwelling from 2.0m to 1.2m, and (3) increase the maximum  permitted lot coverage from 35% to 39%  The requested variances are required to permit the development of a new two storey  detached dwelling on the subject property.  The subject property is located at 405 Cochrane Street and is zoned Residential Type 2  (R2) within Zoning By-law 2585.   In Support of Application  John Koukidis (Agent)    Tom Koukidis (Owner)  In Opposition of Application  Ryan Liebregts  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  J. Koukidis advised the Committee that his comments are the same as noted in  application A/17/19.  The Chair asked if there were any comments from the Committee. There were none.   The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that no correspondence was received.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.   R. Liebregts advised the Committee that he was concerned with the requested 9.5m  maximum permitted building height. He noted that this will cause privacy impacts on  neighbouring uses and will be out of character with the neighbourhood which is primarily  made up of single storey homes.  J. Taylor noted that most homes built in the 1970's were able to comply with the  maximum permitted 8.5m building height in order to accommodate 8' ceilings. However,   Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   newer homes and modern architecture typically require larger floor to ceiling heights  and therefore taller building provisions.  R. Liebregts asked why the Zoning By-law has not been updated to reflect the newer  building standards.   J. Taylor replied that the Town will be addressing this as part of a Comprehensive  Zoning By-law in the future.   D. McCarroll asked if the Land Division Committee will have any input on the building  configuration when the applicant resubmits their application to sever the lands.  J. Taylor replied no. The building shall comply with the Zoning By-law and any approved  variances.  The Chair asked if there was anyone else from the public who wished to speak to the  application. There was no one.     J. Cardwell proposed that Variance #1 regarding the maximum permitted building height  be reduced from 9.5m to 9.0, and to include a condition that the applicant receives a  successful land division (severance) from the Region of Durham.   Moved by: J. Cardwell  That the application to (1) increase the maximum permitted building height from 8.5m to  9.0m (as amended), (2) reduce the minimum required interior side yard setback to the  second storey of the dwelling from 2.0m to 1.2m, and (3) increase the maximum  permitted lot coverage from 35% to 39% located at 405 Cochrane Street (Part 2) be  Granted subject to the following conditions:  1. That the site grading and all other services conform to the requirements of the  Public Works Department;  2. Roof drainage from the proposed structure shall not be directed onto the  adjacent property; and  3. The applicant receives a successful land division (severance) from the Region of  Durham that is final and binding.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variances are  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.

Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   Item 3:  Public Hearings  A/19/19  John Koukidis on Behalf of Wholesome Investments Ltd.  1101 Brock Street South  An application has been received from John Koukidis on behalf of Wholesome  Investments Ltd. for variances from the provisions of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-Law  2585.  The application is for permission to (1) reduce the minimum required rear yard setback  to a refrigeration unit from 7.5m to 4.3m, (2) permit a loading space to encroach into the  exterior side yard between the nearest part of any wall of the main building and the  exterior side lot line, and (3) reduce the minimum required setback to a loading space  from a Residential Zone from 7.5m to 4.3m.  The requested variances are required to permit a proposed refrigeration unit to be  attached to the rear face of the building, extending into the rear yard (south).  The subject property is located at 1101 Brock Street South and is zoned Special  Purpose Commercial (C2-S) within Zoning By-law 2585.In Support of Application   In Support of Application  John Koukidis (Applicant)  In Opposition of Application  None at this time.  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  J. Koukidis introduced himself to the Committee. He stated that an exterior refrigeration  unit is proposed to be located/attached to the south face of the building, within a former  brick garbage enclosure. The existing garbage bin will be shifted westerly towards  Brock Street South and a new enclosure will be constructed around it.   D. McCarroll asked if they have to create a new doorway in the building leading into the  refrigeration unit.  J. Koukidis replied yes. They are going to submit a building permit application for this  work.   N. Chornobay asked what will happen with the existing garbage bin. He also noted that  the entrance as shown on the approved Site Plan was constructed differently.  J. Koukidis replied that the existing garbage bin will be moved further west. The bin is  currently visible to the public. A new enclosure/gate is proposed which will shield the  view of the garbage bin from the parking lot and customers.   Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   The Chair asked if there were any further questions from the Committee. There were  none.     The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that no correspondence was received.   The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.  Moved by: D. McCarroll  That the application to (1) reduce the minimum required rear yard setback to a  refrigeration unit from 7.5m to 4.3m, (2) permit a loading space to encroach into the  exterior side yard between the nearest part of any wall of the main building and the  exterior side lot line, and (3) reduce the minimum required setback to a loading space  from a Residential Zone from 7.5m to 4.3m located at 1101 Brock Street South be  Granted subject to the following conditions:  1. That Variance #1 shall only apply to the location of the proposed refrigeration unit as  illustrated on the applicants submitted drawings;  2. That the site grading and all other services conform to the requirements of the Public  Works Department; and  3. That the loading space shall not encroach past the existing parking stalls located  within the exterior side yard.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variances are  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.   Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   Item 3:  Public Hearings  A/15/19  1138319 Ontario Inc. c/o Delta Rae Homes  Thickson Rd N  An application has been received from 1138319 Ontario Inc. c/o Delta Rae Homes for a  variance from the provisions of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-Law 1784.  The application is for permission to permit an off-site temporary residential sales office  located on the subject property.  The requested variance is required to permit an off-site temporary sales office on the  subject property.   The subject property is located at the south/east corner of Thickson Rd North and  Taunton Road East and is zoned Commercial Mixed Use – Exception 4 (CMU*-4) in  Zoning By-law 1784.  In Support of Application  Carmen Calabrese (Applicant)  Also in Attendance  Ed Lei  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  C. Calabrese introduced himself to the Committee as a representative of Delta Rae  Homes. He noted that they will be offering for sale new homes in a development in  West Whitby. The site that they own can not accommodate a sales office and they  would like to use the existing sales office located on the subject lands as an alternative.  The Chair asked if there is a condition to limit the amount of time the applicant can  operate out of the sale office located on the property.   J. Taylor responded that in past instances the Town has limited the amount of time an  applicant can operate out of an off-site sale office, when a temporary use by-law is  required. In the case of a minor variance there is no statutory time limit unless approved  by the Committee.  C. Calabrese noted that he would prefer that the three year limit be removed from the  conditions given the current state of the housing market.    J. Cardwell asked the applicant how long they intend on occupying the sales office.  C. Calabrese was unaware as the occupancy is dependant on how long it will take them  to sell their homes.   Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   N. Chornobay asked the applicant if they are leasing the existing sales office from the  owner of the property (Luvian Homes).  C. Calabrese replied yes.   J. Taylor confirmed that the applicant will be utilizing the existing sales office on the  property which was formerly operated by Luvian Homes. To his knowledge there is no  active development application proposed for the subject property.  N. Chornobay asked the applicant if they have access permits from the Region.   J. Taylor replied that the applicant will use an existing driveway leading to the sales  office parking lot.   The Chair asked if there were any other questions from the Committee. There were  none.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that no correspondence was received.   The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.   E. Lei introduced himself to the Committee as a resident who lives in the townhouses to  the east of the site. He wanted to know if the applicant planned to expand the existing  parking lot.   C. Calabrese replied no.   N. Chornobay stated that he was prepared to make a motion to approve the variance,  with the removal of condition #1 as it relates to the amount of time the applicant can  occupy the sales office on the property, as stated in the Planning Staff Report.   Moved by: N. Chornobay  That the application to permit an off-site temporary residential sales office located on  the subject property located at Thickson Rd N be Granted subject to the following  condition (as amended):  1. That the site grading and all other services conform to the requirements of the Public  Works Department.  Carried   Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variance is  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.

He stated that he  was opposed to the proposed plan of giving power of selecting a  Deputy Mayor solely to the Mayor, and that he supports maintaining  the current practice. Mr. Dunsmuir inquired about the rationale for  initiating the review, the cost involved in such a review, and  clarification on the review of delegations.  6.2.3 Sandy Hodder, Resident (In-Person Attendance)  Re: Comprehensive Review of the Procedure By-law    Refer to Item 6.5.1, Comprehensive Review of the Procedure  By-law  Sandy Hodder, Resident, appeared before the Committee and  stated she did not support any change to the process of selecting  the Deputy Mayor. She inquired about changing a process that  appears to have been working, and the reason it may no longer be  working.   6.2.4 Deborah Schroeder, Resident (In-Person Attendance)  Re: Comprehensive Review of the Procedure By-law    Refer to Item 6.5.1, Comprehensive Review of the Procedure  By-law  Deborah Schroeder, Resident, appeared before the Committee and  stated that she wanted to understand what Council was trying to  accomplish through a review of the Procedure By-law, and the  reason it was a priority for Council and the citizens of Whitby at this  time. Ms. Schroeder stated that Council should only undertake this  review of the Procedure By-law to ensure that Whitby was pursuing       29  leadership in fairness, democracy, accountability, and being open  and transparent by offering flexible meeting times, opportunities for  constituents to speak, and fairness in sharing the responsibilities  and duties as Deputy Mayor. She noted that for many people  delegating is the only opportunity to speak at meetings, to share  concerns, and for Members of Council to ask the public questions.  She stated that if the public was willing to take the time to delegate  that was important that their voices be heard, noting that this  process was vital to fair government. Ms. Schroeder raised  concerns about limiting who, when, and the amount of time  delegates may speak. She inquired about the purpose of the review  and the reason Council may want to limit democracy,  accountability, transparency, and fairness.  A brief question and answer period ensured between Members of  Committee and Ms. Schroeder regarding the delegate's interest in  being added to an interested party list to receive notification of the  report back to Council.  6.2.5 Russell Leffler, Resident (Virtual Attendance)  Re: Comprehensive Review of the Procedure By-law    Refer to Item 6.5.1, Comprehensive Review of the Procedure  By-law  Russell Leffler, Resident, advised that he would be speaking on  behalf of Rob McLeod under Item 6.2.7 on the agenda.  6.2.6 Denise Boudreau, Resident (Virtual Attendance)  Re: Comprehensive Review of the Procedure By-law  Refer to Item 6.5.1, Comprehensive Review of the Procedure  By-law  Denise Boudreau, Resident, raised concerns about the lack of  accountable and transparent governance when decisions were  made without prior public consultation or consideration of the  negative impacts to certain residential communities. She stated that  a certain faction of the Whitby community has lost trust in elected  officials to consider community impact, public safety, and child  protection issues, noting that it has never been more important that  the voices of the community were heard and acknowledged. Ms.       30  Boudreau enquired about the rationale for choosing to change  processes now, and whether the public may believe the resulting  changes would amplify or stifle the voices of constituents moving  forward. She stated that the duty for consultation was limited to the  Planning Act decisions, noting the discussion, exchange and  consultation that took place earlier in the meeting this evening. Ms.  Boudreau stated that in view of the way decisions were currently  being made with public engagement taking place after the fact, it  would be a further injustice to affect the community should their  voices be limited by restricting delegations and choosing the  Deputy Mayor as a liaison as opposed to following the existing  process for fair representation of the voting public.  A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Ms. Boudreau regarding the delegate's interest in  being added to an interested party list to receive notification of the  report back to Council.  6.2.7 Robert McLeod, Resident (In-Person Attendance)  Re: Comprehensive Review of the Procedure By-law  Refer to Item 6.5.1, Comprehensive Review of the Procedure  By-law  Russell Leffler, Resident, appeared on behalf of Robert McLeod,  Resident, and stated that the current process, in effect in since  1988, was simple, clear, concise, unbiased and did not have any  room for criticism, and that he did not believe that this would be the  case should the process be changed. Mr. Leffler stated that when a  candidate was elected there was a certain expectation of workload,  serving their constituents, and compensation for their efforts. He  stated that many elected officials legitimately want to serve and  give back to the community, they often seek re-election, and some  aspire to move up in the political hierarchy. Mr. Leffler stated that  many constituents want to see the Councillors seek future election  for municipal government and/or possibly the provincial or federal  government. He advised that by changing the way the Deputy  Mayor is appointed, Members of Council lose important visibility by  being taken out of the public eye where Members can build trust  and support for future candidacies. He stated that Councillors  should rally against the proposal to change how the Deputy Mayor       31  would be appointed, noting that Councillors could be robbed of an  opportunity to serve constituents now or in the future.  Moved by Councillor Cardwell  That in accordance with the Town's Procedure By-law, the  Committee of the Whole meeting continue to go past 11:00 p.m.  Carried  It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 6.5.1,  Comprehensive Review of the Procedure By-law, at this time.  6.3  Correspondence  There was no correspondence.  6.4  Staff Reports  6.4.1 CMS 03-24, Community Services Department Report  Re:  Appointment of Members to the Whitby 55+ Recreation  Advisory Committee  Recommendation:  Moved by Councillor Lundquist  That Council approve and appoint the following members to the  Whitby 55+ Recreation Advisory Committee effective immediately  for a term ending December 31, 2025:   Lena Ebrekdjan   Lynda Kruitz   Susan Lythgoe  Carried    6.4.2 LS 03-24, Legal and Enforcement Services Department Report  Re: Assignment and Transfer of Part Block K, Plan M1133,  designated as Part 2 on Plan 40R-30532, being all of PIN 26515- 0401 (LT) from Victorian Order of Nurses Durham Region  Community Corporation to Hospice Whitby  A question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Staff regarding:       32   clarification on altering the condition in the Right of First  Refusal and whether it meant that the owner would be  required to offer the property back to the Town should  construction on the hospice not commence by December 31,  2024;   the possibility of extending the date in Right of First Refusal  Agreement beyond 2024; and,   amending the motion to delegate authority to Staff to extend  the timeline of the Right of First Refusal Agreement if  necessary.
