Beale, Commissioner of Public Works, introduced the report and  explained the purpose of the study is to address the capacity,  operational and safety requirements for Highway 401 within the study  limits, including integration of the planned improvements for the  Highway 407 West Durham Link connection to Highway 401 and a new  Lake Ridge Road Interchange.  She advised the Environmental  Assessment (EA) report is available for agency and public review until  June 10, 2013 and that staff are generally supportive of the  recommendations contained within the Highway 401 from Salem Road  to Brock Street Class Transportation Environmental Study Report  (TESR).  She noted, however, staff are recommending further details  and commitments from the Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO)  prior to the project proceeding to detailed design.  Ms. Beale confirmed  that while many of the Whitby comments have been adequately  addressed by the Highway 401 Project Team and the urgency for the  approval process and initiation of construction has been recognized, it is  staff's opinion that further definitive commitment as a condition of the EA  approval is required for the following items:    1. Brock Street Interchange;  2. Implementation, coordination and staging of Highway 401 with other  area Provincial transportation initiatives;  3. Future financial commitments by the MTO;  4.

Planning and Development     Councillor Mulcahy assumed the Chair.  1.  Presentations    1.1  There were no presentations.    2.  Delegations    2.1  Steve Edwards, Jennifer Francis, and Glenn Taylor representing Atlantic  Packaging Ltd.  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 47-20  Zoning By-law Amendment Application, 2649408 Ontario Limited, 1578  Victoria Street East, File Number: DEV-36-19 (Z-21-19) [Revised]     Refer to Item 4.1, PL 47-20  Steve Edwards, Jennifer Francis, and Glenn Taylor, representing  Atlantic Packaging Ltd., stated both that Gerdau Ameristeel Corporation  and Atlantic Packaging Ltd. recognize the importance of hotel  development to the community and are not opposed to the proposed  development. Mr. Edwards raised concerns about general nuisance,  noise and odour, noting that due to the heavy industry located south of  the proposed development, there may be times that there would be  some visual and noise nuisance for hotel guests. He advised that the  concerns about noise could be reduced by non-operable windows, the  level of glazing on the glass, and the lack of an outdoor amenity area.  He noted that the staff report addressed the issue of noise, and this  could be addressed through site plan approval.   Glenn Taylor, Executive Vice President, Atlantic Packaging Ltd., stated  that the paper mill on site has been in operation since 1990, and that it  was a sustainable business using 100 percent recycled materials. Mr.  Taylor advised that the business was a heavy manufacturing industry,  that operations were ongoing and that the business was undergoing a  major expansion which would more than double production at the  Page 2 of 22  Committee of the Whole Minutes   November 16, 2020 - 7:00 PM    facility. He noted that the business would have an annual payroll of  $20,000,000.00, and local spending of up to $35,000,000.00. He raised  concerns about how another project in the area would manage  nuisances such as the naturally occurring odour from the facility which  they could not do anything about, noting that he wanted to ensure this  matter was addressed within the proposed development.  Jennifer Francis, GHD, read a statement which addressed some of the  concerns related to odour and noted a number of supporting reports  related to air and noise compatibility at the proposed development. Ms.  Francis referenced the Land Use Compatibility Study on air and noise  which was prepared by Golder Associates Ltd. dated December 2019,  noting that Atlantic Packaging Ltd. submitted a letter in August 2020  which identified concerns related to air, odour and noise. She stated that  Atlantic Packaging Ltd. processes were known to produce a wet paper  or cardboard odour. She advised that potentially placing several  hundred new receptors within approximately 200 metres of their facility  would be a source of potential odour complaints that were not pre- existing, and could harm the ability of Atlantic Packaging Ltd. to operate.  Ms. Francis stated that the reports were out of date, and did not reflect  current operations, or take the expansion and increased production at  the Atlantic Packaging Ltd. facility into consideration. She advised that  Environmental Compliance Approval was revoked, noting that the  reports needed to be updated to reflect an accurate Environmental  Compliance Approval. Ms. Francis noted that the qualitative assessment  of air dispersion modelling by Golder Associates Ltd. indicating that the  majority of the stacks at Atlantic Packing Ltd. were less than one (1)  metre above roof level was incorrect and did not reflect operations at  Atlantic. She stated that although the proposed development proposes  sealed windows, it was not clear what type of ventilation system would  be installed. Ms. Francis advised that a single central ventilation system  may be acceptable provided that it would have a properly engineered  odour control system designed to remove odour from Atlantic Packaging  Ltd. She noted that individual ventilation systems for each hotel room  would not be acceptable for odour control. Ms. Francis advised that the  reports indicated that the air intakes should not be located on the south  facades of the proposed hotel, noting that this would be inadequate due  to the air impacts from Atlantic Packaging Ltd. which could occur from  the east, west and south facades. She advised that the reports included  a qualitative assessment for air impacts which was not an acceptable  methodology to accurately assess Atlantic Packaging Ltd.'s impact on  the proposed development, noting that a only a quantitative study could  provide adequate conclusions on compatibility. Ms. Francis advised that  they would assist in preparing the necessary quantitative study to  ensure the Land Use Compatibility Study was updated and reflected  current operations at Atlantic Package Ltd.   Page 3 of 22  Committee of the Whole Minutes   November 16, 2020 - 7:00 PM    Mr. Edwards requested that consideration of the Staff report be  postponed.   A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee,  Steve Edwards, Jennifer Francis, and Glenn Taylor regarding:  • the Noise Impact Study by Golder Associates Ltd. dated July 20,  2020;  • whether the odour concerns were raised with Town Staff prior to  the recommendation report coming forward;  • whether the distance between the proposed development and the  facility at Atlantic Packaging Ltd. would provide any assistance  with the odour concerns;  • whether neighbouring businesses have raised concerns about  the odour from Atlantic Packaging Ltd.;  • mitigation measures to address the odour issue;  • the timeline and rationale for postponing consideration of the  Staff report;  • the timeline for and steps associated with updating the studies;   • repercussions of not addressing the potential odour at the  proposed development pre-construction versus post-construction;   • whether Atlantic Packaging Ltd., regardless of its pre-existing  business operations, would have to manage the impact of odour  on the proposed development;  • safety issues for the potential recipients of the nuisance, noise, or  odour; and,  • whether the concerns related to odour could be addressed  following the approval of the Staff recommendation.      2.2  Michael Fry and Joe Tomaselli representing D.G. Biddle and Associates  Limited  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 47-20  Zoning By-law Amendment Application, 2649408 Ontario Limited, 1578  Victoria Street East, File Number: DEV-36-19 (Z-21-19) [Revised]     Refer to Item 4.1, PL 47-20  Michael Fry, and Joe Tomaselli, representing D.G. Biddle and  Associates Limited, stated that the best information available was used  for completing the Land Use Compatibility Study in December 2019. Mr.  Tomaselli noted that the study identified a potential risk with respect to a  development that did not consider noise and odour issues. Mr.  Tomaselli advised that the noise may be mitigated by the using  inoperable windows, and eliminating, limiting or protecting the outdoor  amenity area from the Atlantic Packing Ltd. facility. He advised that best  Page 4 of 22  Committee of the Whole Minutes   November 16, 2020 - 7:00 PM    information available was used with respect to air/odour, noting that the  Environmental Compliance Approval (ECA) for which the facility was  operating under was referenced. He stated that it was encouraging that  the ECA had been revoked and assumed that it was due to the model  on file being updated. Mr. Tomaselli inquired whether a model for the  facility in its built out form exists, noting that information could be  provided on the proposed development should an updated model exist.  He advised that the concerns raised about the odour could be  addresses through site plan approval or through a holding provision on  the Zoning By-law Amendment.  Michael Fry stated that he had encountered noise and odour concerns  with respect to land use proposals in the past. He further stated that he  recognizes the importance of economic development, and creating and  maintaining employment for the local economy. He advised that he was  willing to cooperate and work with Atlantic Packaging Ltd. and other  representatives to allow the application to move forward. He noted that a  holding provision on the Zoning By-law Amendment would allow the by- law use permissions to be applied to the proposed site which would  allow the owners of the proposed development to obtain the necessary  financing to move forward. Additionally, the holding provision could be  implemented to the satisfaction of Town Staff to ensure that noise and  odour were addressed during site plan approval. Mr. Fry advised that  the owner of the proposed development was amenable to the options  outlined.   A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee,  Mr. Tomaselli and Mr. Fry regarding:  • the number of jobs that would be created by the proposed  development;  • whether consultation between the representatives of Gerdau  Ameristeel Corporation, Atlantic Packaging Limited and the  proponent took place following notification of the Public Meeting;  • the willingness to consult with representatives from Gerdau  Ameristeel Corporation and Atlantic Packaging Limited to  determine the best solutions for the noise and odour concerns;  • whether the proponent was amenable to addressing noise and  odour concerns by implementing inoperable windows and a  central ventilation system with an odour control system to remove  odour created by Atlantic Packaging Ltd.;  • whether additional insulation or other alternatives would be  considered to address the noise impacts; and,  • additional options that may address air quality.      2.3  Stuart Craig, John Liang, Ryan Matthews, Darren Sims, and Hayden  Page 5 of 22  Committee of the Whole Minutes   November 16, 2020 - 7:00 PM    Ameerali representing A&W  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 50-20  Sign By-law Variance to Permanent Sign By-law for (A&W), File  Number: SB-04-20     Refer to Item 4.4, PL 50-20  Stuart Craig, John Liang, Ryan Matthews, and Darren Sims,  representing A&W appeared before Committee. Mr. Craig stated that he  was the owner/landlord of the property located at 1208 Dundas Street  East, and that he was requested to appear on behalf of A&W to assist in  securing any necessary approvals to install the drive-through menu  board sign. Mr. Craig advised that additional signage had been  requested through a Sign By-law Variance application to amend the  Town's Permanent Sign By-law in May 2020 which was denied by  Council. He further advised that the previous application included a  drive-through menu board sign, noting that this type of signage would be  critical to the operation of the business. He advised that due to the  COVID-19 pandemic, it was anticipated that 90 percent of A&W's  customers would be served via the drive through. Mr. Craig stated that  A&W was planning to open within the next couple of weeks, noting that  without a menu board sign representing the food choices available it  would be particularly difficult for the business to operate, and that it  would have an adverse impact on business. Mr. Craig stated that there  would be multiple food choices offered including breakfast and healthy  food options. Mr. Craig advised that the fast food industry was changing  prior to COVID-19 and it now offers various food options. He stated that  the added challenge in Whitby was the relatively new restriction on the  permitted size of one (1) square metre for a menu board sign, noting  that the majority of existing businesses in the area have larger signs  which enable the presentation of food choices to their customers. He  stated that it would be difficult to start up a new business in the current  climate, and that it was essential for the business to have a drive- through menu board sign as proposed which would allow for a larger  menu selection. Mr. Craig noted that although A&W was a  national/international company, this particular business would be  operated by a local franchisee which anticipated the employment of forty  (40) full-time and part-time staff. Mr. Craig stated that he would like to  see the business get a good start, be successful, and be able to open in  an environment that best allows it to thrive. He requested that the  Committee support and approve the application for the Sign By-law  Variance to the Permanent Sign By-law.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee,  Mr. Craig, Mr. Liang, Mr. Matthews and Mr. Sims regarding:  • confirmation that the drive-through menu board sign would not be  Page 6 of 22  Committee of the Whole Minutes   November 16, 2020 - 7:00 PM    visible from the road frontages of Dundas Street and Anderson  Street or the sidewalk;  • the timeline for the opening of all three businesses on the site;  • the rationale for the size of drive-through menu board sign, and  whether a smaller menu board sign would be suitable;  • confirmation on the location of the drive-through menu board  sign; and,  • confirmation on the size and type of menu board sign, and that it  would be a menu board sign with static images of the products  offered.      2.4  Peter Kulkarni and Angela Mariani representing Triovest Realty Advisors  & Nautical Lands Group  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 52-20  Taunton Gardens Pedestrian Improvements, 7902484 Canada Inc., c/o  Triovest Realty Advisors & Nautical Lands Group, 304, 308, 368, 372,  374 and 378 Taunton Road East, File Number: SP-44-18    Refer to Item 4.6, PL 52-20  Peter Kulkarni and Angela Mariani, representing Triovest Realty  Advisors & Nautical Lands Group, advised that they were available to  answer questions from Members of Committee.

New and Unfinished Business - Planning and Development    5.1  New and Unfinished Business - Planning and Development  There was no new and unfinished business.      General Government     Councillor Leahy assumed the Chair.  6.  Presentations    6.1  There were no presentations.    7.  Delegations    7.1  Roger Caughell, Chair, Whitby 55+ Recreation Advisory Committee  Re: Community Services Department Report, CMS 06-20  55+ Van Service     Refer to Item 9.2, CMS 06-20  Page 12 of 22  Committee of the Whole Minutes   November 16, 2020 - 7:00 PM    Roger Caughell, Chair, Whitby 55+ Recreation Advisory Committee,  advised that following discussion and review of the seniors van service,  the Whitby 55+ Recreation Advisory Committee unanimously agreed  that the decision to discontinue the seniors van service was the correct  decision. Mr. Caughell stated that the decision to discontinue the service  took place in January 2019, noting that there was a substantial reduction  in ridership, and that the service appeared to have lost its relevance with  impatient riders frequently finding their own way home instead of waiting  for the scheduled return trip. He advised that arranging for drivers and  scheduling trips for a few riders took an excessive amount of staff and  volunteer hours during a time when program demands for the general  membership was growing. Mr. Caughell stated that Staff from the  Whitby Seniors' Activity Centre and the Whitby 55+ Recreation Advisory  Committee members did not make the decision without care and  empathy, noting that Members of the Committee called each rider to  inform them of the decision, provided a list of alternatives, displayed ride  sharing posters in the centre, and urged program attendees to ride  share whenever possible. He advised that the van service was  discontinued in September 2019, and that staff carefully monitored the  van service riders, fielded questions and suggested alternative  transportation methods. In February 2020, staff surveyed the riders and  determined that all but four individuals had made alternative  arrangements including, ride sharing, taxis, public transit, and special  transit. Mr. Caughell advised that the van was sold for $$34,665.00, and  that the Whitby 55+ Recreation and Advisory Committee requested that  the proceeds of the sale be committed to the Seniors Transportation  Reserve Fund. He noted that there would be expenses for building  improvements at the Whitby Seniors' Activity Centre, the addition of  space at the Village of Taunton Mills, expanded seniors' 55+  programming, and that there would be reduced revenue due to the  COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Caughell acknowledged that challenges were  incurred by a few individuals, noting that they, as part of the  membership of the Whitby Seniors' Activity Centre, would also benefit  from the decision for many years.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Mr. Caughell regarding:  • results of the survey including whether any seniors impacted by  the discontinuation of the van service have incurred financial  hardship;  • whether the Whitby 55+ Recreation Advisory Committee has  explored provincial or federal support to assist seniors accessing  in-person programs at the Whitby Seniors' Activity Centre;  • an organized plan to assist physically or financially vulnerable  seniors to access programs when in-person programs resume;  Page 13 of 22  Committee of the Whole Minutes   November 16, 2020 - 7:00 PM    and,  • whether the 55+ Recreation Advisory Committee had contacted  individuals who were unhappy about the cancellation of the van  service.      7.2  Akuah Frempong, Angela Todd Anderson, Judy Douglas, and Vanessa  Reid representing the Congress of Black Women, Oshawa/Whitby  Chapter  Re: Community Services Department Report, CMS 07-20  Whitby Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Committee Update      Refer to Item 9.1, CMS 07-20  Akuah Frempong, Angela Todd Anderson, Judy Douglas, and Vanessa  Reid, representing the Congress of Black Women, Oshawa/Whitby  Chapter, advised that the Congress of Black Women, Oshawa/Whitby  Chapter had the opportunity to provide a presentation at the Whitby  Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Committee (WDIAC) meeting on  October 1, 2020. Ms. Frempong cited their mission based on the  foundational pillars of the organization. She stated that given the  heightened race relations across North America during the summer and  the racism that continues to plague our society, that anti-black racism  and anti-racism continues to be an issue that affects black women, black  people, indigenous people and people of colour in Whitby, across the  Region of Durham, across Canada, and across the world. She stated  that the Town of Whitby and the Region of Durham have made efforts to  combat unfortunate events, but that it was not enough. She advised that  she had requested that the WDIAC prepare a motion to Council to have  mandatory diversity and inclusion training for all public employees,  volunteers, and anyone with any public affiliation with the Town of  Whitby. She requested that training be implemented as soon as  possible, noting that any measures to combat anti-black racism and anti- racism would be unjust should the people who are responsible for daily  events, including but not limited to, Council, Fire and Police Services, do  not have the basic understanding and knowledge of diversity and  inclusion. Ms. Frempong commented on the seminar by Allison Hector- Alexander held on September 29, 2020 which provided basic  information on anti-racism, unconscious bias, and diversity and  inclusion, noting that it was this type of material that should be included  as a whole session and provided to public employees, volunteers, and  affiliates of the Town of Whitby. Ms. Frempong stated that the Congress  of Black Women, Oshawa/Whitby Chapter supports the WDIAC's  recommendation to implement mandatory anti-black racism, diversity  and inclusion, and unconscious bias awareness training for all Town of  Whitby Staff, Council, and Town supported and non-supported local  Page 14 of 22  Committee of the Whole Minutes   November 16, 2020 - 7:00 PM    board and advisory committee members.  Angela Todd Anderson inquired about the formation of a sub-committee  of the WDIAC whose focus would be on anti-black racism and  unconscious bias training.   A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee,  Ms. Frempong, Ms. Anderson, Ms. Douglas, and Ms. Reid regarding:  • whether the formation of a sub-committee of the WDIAC or a  committee separate and apart from the WDIAC would be best  suited to advise on issues of equity, anti-black racism, and anti- racism, and priorities identified by the black community;  • suggestions in conjunction with training and apart from the  proposed creation of a sub-committee that would assist in guiding  the Town to address anti-black racism;  • whether discussion or a request took place with respect to the  creation of a sub-committee at the WDIAC meeting;   • clarification on the composition of the proposed sub-committee of  the WDIAC and the proposed sub-committee reporting to the  WDIAC;  • confirmation that Allison Hector-Alexander has implemented  training for staff at Durham College of Applied Arts and  Technology, and that a format currently exists for training that  could be shared and assist with training within the Town of  Whitby; and,  • communicating the request to form a sub-committee of the  WDIAC to the WDIAC for its consideration.      7.3  Cora Reid representing the Black Rose Movement Durham  Re: Community Services Report, CMS 07-20  Whitby Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Committee Update     Refer to Item 9.1, CMS 07-20  Cora Reid, representing the Black Rose Movement Durham, stated that  the movement started as a way of connecting with stakeholders in the  community and that although it was not intended to become a  movement it did become a movement in 2016. Ms. Reid stated that she  was in support of the WDIAC's recommendation to implement  mandatory training for Town Staff, Council and Town-supported and  Town non-supported local boards and advisory committee members.  She noted that this would be one of the many steps to move forward  with the positive direction of anti-black and systemic racism. Ms. Reid  commented on her interest in the response from Members of Council on  the question of what racism was and the definition of racism. She  Page 15 of 22  Committee of the Whole Minutes   November 16, 2020 - 7:00 PM    inquired whether the answer would be that racism was a result of being  treated poorly or unfairly due the colour of your skin, the denial of  human rights or to live in fear because of your skin colour, or the denial  of fair treatment, equality, resources and education rights because of  your skin colour. She inquired about responses to personal experiences  with racism. Ms. Reid stated that the answer to that question would vary  based on experiences, including but not limited to, what you were  taught, how you were raised, what neighbourhood you lived in, and what  education you received. She advised that the reality about racism was  that it was not something you were born with, but what you were taught,  and that your views and ideas were formed on the basis of the  information you received and were taught. Ms. Reid noted that all  people have biases. She advised that the problem with being biased  was the position of influence you may be in and making life altering  decisions from the place of bias. Ms. Reid stated that the reason for her  support of the WDIAC recommendation was to start dismantling anti- black and systemic racism, noting that it was imperative for any  individual holding a title of leader to receive training and to have  understanding of their bias. She further stated that racism does exist  and the truth was that many people have been oppressed because of  decisions that have been made, and have been negatively impacted  because of bias. She noted that in the black community there were  generational traumas as a result of implicit or explicit bias.    A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Ms. Reid regarding:  •  any advice Ms. Reid could provide related to the design,  implementation of training, and monitoring inclusive practices  across the Town and in the community; and,  • whether Ms. Reid would accept an invitation to speak at the next  WDIAC meeting.    8.

He stated that the current process  was not sustainable and that residents would be left paying high taxes  as noted in the Service Delivery Review conducted by KPMG and that  there was a need to fight for what is right and for the taxpayers.     5.

Mayor Mitchell did not take part in the  discussion and voting on this matter.      General Government     Councillor Roy assumed the Chair.  1.  Presentations    1.1  There were no presentations.    2.  Delegations    2.1  Mary-Ann Nova, Heather Hawco-Gray, and Greg Kruk representing  Nova's Ark  Re: Legal and Enforcement Services Report, LS 16-21  Prohibited & Regulated Animals By-law Exemption Request for Nova's  Ark – 7505 Cedarbrook Trail     Refer to Item 4.7, LS 16-21  Mary-Ann Nova, Heather Hawco-Gray, and Greg Kruk, representing  Nova's Ark, provided details of the insurance policies in place for Nova's  Ark located at 7505 Cedarbrook Trail. Mr. Kruk advised that there have  been numerous loss control visits at the property, inspections for  evaluation purposes, and liability exposures. He noted that any  deficiencies that were noted were remedied immediately.  Ms. Hawco-Gray, stated that she was a child and youth practitioner and  a registered social service worker. She advised that she has worked in  the field of child and youth mental health for over 35 years and provided  details of the various settings she has worked in over her career. She  stated that she was a volunteer at Nova's Ark and was on the Board of  Directors for over 13 years. Ms. Hawco-Gray advised that Nova's Ark  has provided care to families within the Region of Durham and beyond.  She further advised that Nova's Ark uses animal assisted therapy which  is an alternative therapeutic modality that can be used to promote  quality of life. She noted that animal therapy has had many positive  health benefits that impact mental, emotional, psychological and  physical health. Ms. Hawco-Gray provided details of the various benefits  provided by simply petting and interacting with animals. She stated that,  unlike humans, one the best traits about animals was that they were  accepting, inclusive and non-judgmental. She stated that some of the  animals used at Nova's Ark were not generally used for therapy but that  Page 2 of 27  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 27, 2021 - 7:00 PM    at Nova's Ark they belong. Ms. Hawco-Gray advised that the animals  were essential for guests to see that anything is possible, noting that  when a wolf was treated well in a nurturing environment that it thrives  and enjoys the company of humans. She stated that these animals  restore faith in humanity to accept others and live in harmony with each  other. It allows them to see that perceptions were based on what one  believes to be true and not the actual truth.    Ms. Nova stated that Nova's Ark was a unique facility and was not like  any other facility in Canada or the United States. She advised that  Nova's Ark values human interaction, and that it works with individuals  who have been marginalized by utilizing the animals that have also been  marginalized. Ms. Nova stated that Nova's Ark was cutting edge. She  noted that there were many changes occurring in the world, and that  assisted therapy has become very strong particularly in the United  States of America. She noted that Nova's Ark continues to be multi- faceted and includes education for children, therapy, and internships  with high schools, universities, and colleges that look for unique  strategies that would make a difference. Ms. Nova extended an  invitation to Members of Committee to visit Nova's Ark.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee,  Ms. Nova, Ms. Hawco-Gray, and Mr. Kruk regarding:  • the length of time that Nova's Ark has been in existence; and,  • the total amount of insurance in place for Nova's Ark.      2.2  Jim Lines, President, Invictus International Management Services  Limited  Re: Legal and Enforcement Services Report, LS 16-21  Prohibited & Regulated Animals By-law Exemption Request for Nova's  Ark – 7505 Cedarbrook Trail     Refer to Item 4.7, LS 16-21  Jim Lines, President, Invictus International Management Services  Limited, advised that he was requested to undertake a security  perimeter review of Nova's Ark in April 2021 to provide an overview of  what was necessary to protect the property from unwanted visitors, to  assess the animal enclosures, and to provide any necessary  recommendations. He advised that he was working with Ms. Nova to  submit a comprehensive report. Mr. Lines advised that he inspected the  perimeter of both the interior and exterior of the Nova's Ark fencing to  ascertain how difficult it would be to access the property without using  the laneway access to the property. He advised that the area was  covered or surrounded by swamp, brush, and thorn bushes making it  difficult for anyone to gain access to the property without using the  Page 3 of 27  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 27, 2021 - 7:00 PM    existing laneway. He stated that based on his experience in the military  and working in conservation that the only way to access the property  outside of the laneway access would be to intentionally attempt to  breach the perimeter. Mr. Lines advised that numerous photographs  were taken to demonstrate the difficulty in gaining access to and  breaching the fence. He advised that he would answer any questions  regarding the security of the property.  The Chair referenced correspondence dated September 24, 2021 and  September 27, 2021 submitted to the Town by Mr. Lines.      2.3  Eve Magnus, Resident  Re: Legal and Enforcement Services Report, LS 16-21  Prohibited & Regulated Animals By-law Exemption Request for Nova's  Ark – 7505 Cedarbrook Trail     Refer to Item 4.7, LS 16-21  Eve Magnus, 29 McIvor Street, stated that she has been a resident of  Whitby for 19 years. She advised that her son and her daughter have  volunteered at Nova's Ark, noting that she also volunteered at Nova's  Ark prior to working there. Ms. Magnus stated she previously worked at  Resources for Exceptional Children and Youth - Durham Region, noting  that Durham Region has programs for children of various abilities within  child care centres, but that it was difficult for parents with children  entering the school system to access resources that do not have long  waiting lists.  Ms. Magnus stated that the program at Nova's Ark was  unique because it involves nature and the natural environment. She  stated that many people have considered the accomplishments  achieved by Nova's Ark unreachable and nothing short of miraculous.  She advised that the animal interactions were an integral part of the  program that demonstrates regulation, teaching self regulation as well  as being able to bring guests, adults and children out of their shells  unlike any other program that she has witnessed. She advised that the  link between the misconceptions and stereotypes that follow both people  with exceptionalities and various types of animals were similar. She  noted that misconceptions are invalidated at Nova's Ark through  understanding, compassion, education, and by demonstrating how a  safe, caring environment could help shape who we are. Ms. Magnus  noted that animals like the wolves, the bobcat and the lynx may be  portrayed by some people as dangerous and/or a nuisance in the  natural environment to uninformed people, and that many people with  exceptionalities face such misconceptions every day of their lives. She  stated that these myths are put to rest at Nova's Ark due to the gentle  nature of the animals that creates an understanding and a bond  Page 4 of 27  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 27, 2021 - 7:00 PM    between the guest and animal. She stated that the fact that there has  never been an incident over a period of 16 years, and the safety and  well-being of each animal on the premises was a testament to the care  and concern of Ms. Nova and her animal care team. Ms. Magnus stated  that taking away something that has become so meaningful to a specific  portion of the population who are most ignored would be detrimental not  only to people and families directly involved but to the whole community.  She further stated that Nova's Ark was a testament to Whitby's  community care and spirit and has put Whitby on the map as having one  of the best programs for people with varied abilities and exceptionalities.  She noted that to see Nova's Ark first hand with the guests and the  difference Nova's Ark was making was something that you would not  see in any other program. Ms. Magnus invited Members of Committee to  visit and witness the animals and guests at Nova's Ark.      2.4  Kathy Wall, Resident  Re: Legal and Enforcement Services Report, LS 16-21  Prohibited & Regulated Animals By-law Exemption Request for Nova's  Ark – 7505 Cedarbrook Trail     Refer to Item 4.7, LS 16-21  Kathy Wall, 7260 Baldwin Street North, stated that she was in  attendance to speak as a neighbour, a parent of a volunteer, a  volunteer, and as a police officer, in support of Nova's Ark. She advised  that she has been a neighbour of Nova's Ark for 14 years, and that her  property abuts the property of Nova's Ark. Ms. Wall stated that she first  became aware of Nova's Ark when her daughter was 5 years old and  her family attended Nova's Ark Friendship Walk in Grass Park in  Brooklin. She noted that her daughter showed no fear, and that she was  interested in learning about all of the animals and how to become a  volunteer at Nova's Ark. Ms. Wall advised that when her daughter turned  12 she became a volunteer at Nova's Ark. She stated that her daughter  has been working at Nova's Ark for the past 5 years and has  accumulated over 1500 volunteer hours. She noted that many of her  daughter's responsibilities encompassed animal care. Ms. Wall advised  that after attending the Nova's Ark Friendship Walks and touring the  property over the years she always felt comfortable leaving her daughter  at Nova's Ark to work, noting that she was at no time concerned about  her daughter getting hurt due to her interaction with the animals or any  of the work she performed. Ms. Wall stated that she became a volunteer  two years ago and that she has had opportunities to work with some of  the most interesting animals. She noted that she has not been at any  time concerned about her own safety or the safety of people or guests  around her. She advised that Ms. Nova has gone above and beyond to  Page 5 of 27  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 27, 2021 - 7:00 PM    provide safe enclosures for all of the animals, noting that only specific  experienced animal care employees have keys to the enclosures to  protect the animals and to ensure the safety of the guests, staff and  volunteers. Ms. Wall advised that she spent the past 12 years  developing her skill set so that she could better serve members of her  community who live with mental health issues. She stated that she  recognizes the value and impact of animal companionship and has  witnessed how it affects the mental health and the daily lives of people.  She advised that animal therapy was being used by the Durham Region  Critical Incident Stress Support Team. She stated that she has a  stressful job and was aware of the affect that Nova's Ark has had on her  own mental health. Ms. Wall stated that Nova's Ark was filled with  laughter and positivity that was infectious. She noted that Ms. Nova has  surrounded herself with a core group of competent staff dedicated to  making their guests feel welcome, included and respected. Ms. Wall  stated that as important as the staff at Nova's Ark were, it would not be  what it is without their unique collection of animals, noting that every  animal was special in its own way. She noted that the guests and  animals are valued, respected and protected. Ms. Wall stated that  concerns have been raised about predatory animals specifically  pertaining to the wolves. She advised that she felt a need to address the  concerns in an attempt to dispel myths associated with the wolves. Ms.  Wall stated that she has taken part in the socialization of the wolves and  has first hand knowledge about their demeanor and temperament. She  advised that the wolves came to Nova's Ark as pups prior to their eyes  being open, that they were hand raised and bottle fed for the purpose of  bonding and imprinting with people. Ms. Wall noted that the pups were  raised in Ms. Nova's home with two dogs and house cats long before  they moved to their outside enclosure. She stated that the wolves have  never been aggressive with people or other animals and have lovely  dispositions. She advised that they weigh 100 pounds and are fully  grown. She stated that it was important to share her experience with the  wolves because people fear what they do not understand. Ms. Wall  advised that knowledge was power and ignorance should never be the  foundation for making decisions about something that one does not  know anything about. Ms. Wall stated that her job relies on assessing  risks and making informed decisions based on fact. She advised that  Ms. Nova and Nova's Ark has provided an incredible service for the past  16 years, that there have not been any instances where staff, guests, or  volunteers have been attacked or harmed, and that the animals were  treated with as much respect and dignity as the guests. Ms. Wall stated  that Ms. Nova was not operating a zoo, but that she was an educator  with over 25 years of experience in teaching and offering unique ways of  learning in a unique environment, and that Ms. Nova has earned the  Page 6 of 27  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 27, 2021 - 7:00 PM    trust of the community with a proven track record for safety, making  good decisions, and transparency.      2.5  Sarah Rapp, Resident  Re: Legal and Enforcement Services Report, LS 16-21  Prohibited & Regulated Animals By-law Exemption Request for Nova's  Ark – 7505 Cedarbrook Trail     Refer to Item 4.7, LS 16-21  Sarah Rapp, 7485 Cedarbrook Trail, stated that she resides in Brooklin  and that her property was located directly south of Nova's Ark. Ms. Rapp  advised she has lived in Brooklin for many years and has watched  Nova's Ark grow from a small local organization that offered therapeutic,  educational summer camps a few weeks in the summer that consisted  of handful of children, volunteers and animals. She advised that the  organization has grown exponentially and that it currently houses 397  animals. She advised that the number of enclosures have increased and  the property may have over 80 people attending a day between clientele  and volunteers. Ms. Rapp advised that the reality of daily life for her  family was that their neighbour has wolves. She advised that the  animals at the facility includes lynxes, a bobcat, pythons, boa  constrictors, a caracal, a serval, and multiple large predatory animals.  She noted that these animals have the potential to cause severe harm  or death to her family, children visiting the facility, the volunteers  attending their facility, and the residents of Brooklin. Ms. Rapp stated  that the wolves, bobcat and one of the lynx were housed just a few feet  from their shared property line. She raised concerns about the safety of  her children who want to explore her own property. She advised that  most residents in Brooklin have no idea that such wild animals were  kept by residents who appear to have no formal training, experience or  authority to allow the keeping of these animals just a couple of  kilometres away from their homes and schools. Ms. Rapp inquired  whether the Town would notify the residents of Brooklin about the  existing animals and that consideration was being given to allowing  Nova's Ark to keep them. She further inquired about why Brooklin  residents had not been notified, and whether they were notified about  this meeting. Ms. Rapp asked why Nova's Ark has been allowed to  obtain and keep these animals without warning the neighbours and  residents of Brooklin. She noted that Cedarbrook Trail was a popular  road for walkers, joggers, small children riding bikes with their parents,  and dog walkers. Ms. Rapp stated that each time she leaves her home  she passes people enjoying the rural setting of the road.       Recommendation:  Page 7 of 27  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 27, 2021 - 7:00 PM      Moved By Councillor Yamada    That the rules of procedure be suspended to allow the delegation to  exceed the five minute speaking limit.    Carried    Ms. Rapp continued her delegation and inquired about whether  residents should be warned about these potentially dangerous,  prohibited animals and the potential risk of escaped animals. She  inquired about who would be responsible for the potential risk of  escaped animals, and what liability the Town of Whitby would have for  allowing this to take place. Ms. Rapp stated that she recognizes the  need for this type of therapeutic and educational programming that  Nova's Ark offers to people and its value to the community, but that, in  her opinion, none of these animals were necessary to offer therapeutic  educational services. Ms. Rapp inquired about how Ms. Nova could  focus on the education of all the children, manage multiple volunteers  and staff, and properly care for 397 animals. She asked about the  number of accessory buildings that have been built over the last 5 years  without building permits, noting that there was a 2000 square foot  tropical barn that was constructed at the end of 2019. She inquired  about whether there was building permit for the tropical barn, and how  many accessory buildings were permitted on one property. Ms. Rapp  raised concerns about a pile of manure in the pasture that drains into  her property, and inquired about dangers of disease being carried by  coyotes or seeping into the ground water. She stated that the Town  passed the Prohibited & Regulated Animals By-law to protect Whitby  residents and to protect animals. She stated that no one governs this  property and ensures that structures and fences were constructed  properly.     The Chair referenced the correspondence dated September 27, 2021  submitted to the Town by Ms. Rapp.     A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Ms. Rapp regarding:    • confirmation of and details about escaped animals from Nova's  Ark that have been seen on Ms. Rapp's property and whether  there was any follow-up by Nova's Ark about the escaped  animals; and,    • details about the height and materials used for the construction of  the fence located between Nova's Ark and Ms. Rapp's property.    Page 8 of 27  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 27, 2021 - 7:00 PM    2.6  Martin Field, 1134 Somerville Street, Oshawa  Re: Legal and Enforcement Services Report, LS 16-21  Prohibited & Regulated Animals By-law Exemption Request for Nova's  Ark – 7505 Cedarbrook Trail     Refer to Item 4.7, LS 16-21  Martin Field, 1134 Somerville Street, Oshawa, stated that he was the  Vice President of the City of Oshawa Animal Advisory Committee. Mr.  Field stated that in spite of the good intentions of Nova's Ark, it has been  established that this facility has acquired many more animals including  two wolves, a North American Bobcat, a Siberian Lynx, a Caracal, a  Canadian Lynx, an African Khal and a Serval. He advised that due to  high level of acquisition of animals and as noted in the Staff report, 118  animals violate the Town's Prohibited and Regulated Animals By-law.  He raised concerns about the level of assurance of future compliance  that the Town could expect given past practices, and the level of  scrutiny, due diligence, and frequency of inspections that residents  could be assured would take place in the future. Mr. Field raised  concerns about the effective containment of the animals, the prospects  of escape, and the safety and well-being of neighbours, noting that a  personal on-site visit over the weekend revealed six-inch gaps on the  underside of the perimeter fencing and a 6-foot high perimeter fence  which would not be sufficient to impede an animal from easily scaling  the fence. Mr. Field raised further concerns about the location of Nova's  Ark due to urban encroachment and the proximity to urban population  should an animal escape. He expressed concerns about two accessory  structures that were been constructed without permits and inquired  about how the Town would address the matter. Mr. Field noted the  current practice of Nova's Ark permits the entry of vulnerable children  into the cages of animals including any one of the aforementioned  dangerous animals. He stated that in his opinion whether the children  were accompanied by a trained member of staff or a volunteer was  immaterial. He stated that the Town was exposed to risks and liability  subject to the application of strict liability that relates to negligence. He  stated that, in his opinion, that due to the variety of species and the  layout of the facility, Nova's Ark could be considered as a Zoo. He  advised that past case law established the distinction between strict  liability and that of negligence, noting the established practice of Nova's  Ark and its mission statement where it refers to allowing the entry of  children, many with disabilities, into all animal cages and where the  animal was without any form of restraint. He stated that if a visitor was  within a cage or enclosure and if they were injured or killed, the higher  application of law of strict liability would be likely to apply in addition to  negligence. Mr. Field commented that the presence of a member of staff  Page 9 of 27  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 27, 2021 - 7:00 PM    or volunteer, regardless of training, would be legally immaterial as a  defense and could add to the case as the child had placed their entire  safety and trust in that member of staff or volunteer. He noted that all  that would need to occur would be for the wild animal be found outside  the control of the owner or keeper and that it would not need to escape  in order for strict liability to apply. Therefore, in addition to Nova's Ark,  the Town would have exposed itself to encounter legal action. He urged  the Town to take immediate and permanent action. Mr. Field advised  that he was in support of Option # 3 in the Staff report.  The Chair acknowledged receipt of the correspondence submitted to the  Town by Mr. Field.      2.7  Nicholas Wilvert,196 Oshawa Boulevard North, Oshawa  Re: Legal and Enforcement Services Report, LS 16-21  Prohibited & Regulated Animals By-law Exemption Request for Nova's  Ark – 7505 Cedarbrook Trail    Refer to Item 4.7, LS 16-21  Nicholas Wilvert, 196 Oshawa Boulevard North, Oshawa, stated that he  wanted to provide his personal experience at Nova's Ark as a volunteer  and as a seasonal paid employee from 2007 to 2012. He stated that he  witnessed the positive impact that Nova's Ark camp programs have had  on those in the community. Mr. Wilvert stated that he believes that  certain aspects of the animal therapy program at Nova's Ark provides  great pleasure and unique experiences for children that attend its  camps. He stated that over his 5-year tenure at Nova's Ark he witnessed  dozens of dangerous encounters between people and many of the  exotic or dangerous animals that were at the facility. He stated that  given the current inventory of prohibited species, it would appear that  the number of animals involved in incidents would far exceed the  number of incidents that occurred during his tenure when there were  200 animals on site versus the current 397 animals. Mr. Wilvert stated  that few of the larger dangerous exotic animals were obtained legally  during his tenure, noting that most often the animals were purchased at  exotic animal auctions that were run in small towns out of the public eye.  He advised that he brought all of the incidents that took place during his  tenure to the attention of Whitby Animal Services in 2012. He stated that  he was met with hostility with an explanation that Nova's Ark does good  work with children. He detailed instances of the most notable and  alarming negative human/animal interactions that he witnessed at  Nova's Ark. He noted that based on the current inventory, Nova's Ark  still has kinkajous which are an exotic member of the raccoon family that  have injured people, but continue to interact directly with children at  Page 10 of 27  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 27, 2021 - 7:00 PM    Nova's Ark. Mr. Wilvert stated that the instances that he outlined were  just a few of many jarring stories that stem from Nova's Ark involving  dangerous animals. He stated that Nova's Ark provides much needed  respite and programs for children and that he would not want to see  anything hinder their ability to do so. He stated that in his experience at  Nova's Ark the use of exotic and predatory animals in direct contact with  children that may have an altered ability to communicate or the inability  to escape a dangerous situation due to being wheelchair bound was a  constant source of stress for staff. He advised that this resulted in many  unpredictable situations involving animals that inherently cannot be  tamed or trained particularly by volunteers at Nova's Ark who for the  most part have no formal training in the behaviour and handling of these  species. Mr. Wilvert stated that despite his lengthy time at Nova's Ark  working and volunteering in animal therapy programs that he still fails to  understand what benefits interactions with a lynx or a bobcat provide a  child that cannot be obtained from interaction with a domesticated goat,  cat, dog or horse. He commented that any person would be hard  pressed to find a peer reviewed study that would find any therapeutic  benefit that could be provided by exotic and predatory animals. Mr.  Wilvert noted that from his own experience he believed that Nova's Ark  was a much needed staple in the community as long as they were  working with domesticated animals, but that as long as they continue to  provide direct contact between dangerous animals and children they  would be posing an unnecessary danger to the community. He advised  that the quality or height of fencing does not matter should you be inside  an enclosure with a wolf or a camel.  A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Mr. Wilvert regarding whether Mr. Wilvert raised  concerns prior to leaving Nova's Ark and the results of raising such  concerns.      2.8  Michele Hamers representing World Animal Protection  Re: Legal and Enforcement Services Report, LS 16-21  Prohibited & Regulated Animals By-law Exemption Request for Nova's  Ark – 7505 Cedarbrook Trail     Refer to Item 4.7, LS 16-21  Michele Hamers, representing World Animal Protection, raised concerns  about the request by Nova's Ark for an exemption to the Prohibited and  Regulated Animals By-law. Ms. Hamers acknowledged that Nova's Ark  was a wonderful initiative, noting that animals can be good companions  for people and reduce stress. She advised that her concerns were  related to the use and welfare of wild animals for in-person interactions,  Page 11 of 27  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 27, 2021 - 7:00 PM    noting that the majority of animals in possession at Nova's Ark were wild  animals. She stated that these animals, whether born in captivity or in  the wild, and whether hand-reared or not, have characteristics and  behavioural and social needs which are difficult, if not impossible, to  meet in captive settings. She noted that these animals have not co- evolved with people and interactions with them would not be in their best  interest. Ms. Hamers stated that interactions with these animals could  promote a false narrative that the animals were safe to be around and  that they make suitable companions. Ms. Hamers stated that she  understood that Nova's Ark currently has approximately 400 animals  housed on a 10-acre property which was a very high number of wild  animals to be taken care of, which was unusual even for a professionally  run zoo. She noted that the Greater Vancouver Zoo which is CAZA  accredited was located on 120 acres of land with a live collection of  about 600 animals. She stated that the limited acreage at Nova's Ark  raises concerns about whether animal welfare would be safeguarded at  all. Ms. Hamers expressed concerns about the interactions between wild  animals and participants. She stated that the reason why these animals  were prohibited in more than 200 municipalities in Ontario was because  they have wild characteristics that could inflict harm on people. Ms.  Hamers noted that professionally run zoos with highly trained staff never  allow interactions between the public and animals such as wolves and  snakes or other potentially dangerous animals and especially not within  the animal's enclosure. She stated that the enclosure was the animal's  territory and where the animal feeds. Ms. Hamers noted that trained zoo  staff would not go into enclosures either and practice a hands-off  husbandry approach which means no direct contact takes place. Ms.  Hamers advised that public health agencies across Canada, including  Durham Public Health, strongly advises against interactions between  reptiles, birds, young ruminants and humans that are considered to be  at risk. She advised that at risk individuals include children under the  age of five, individuals older than 65 years of age, pregnant individuals,  and individuals with developmental disabilities. She noted that the  aforementioned animals were known carriers of zoonotic diseases like  salmonella which can be transmitted to individuals who come in contact  with the animals or with any surfaces the animals have contacted. Ms.  Hamers advised that any blanket exemption could result in an unfettered  birth of animals. She stated that there were not any regulations in  Ontario that prohibit keeping any exotic wild animals and that currently  only orcas could be prohibited, therefore, there could be a growth in  animals including lions and tigers and other dangerous animals. Ms.  Hamers advised that were not any standards or regulations for obtaining  animal therapy which means that there was not any protection for  people that interact with these animals. She advised that World Animal  Page 12 of 27  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 27, 2021 - 7:00 PM    Protection recommends that the Town of Whitby denies the request for  exemption by Nova's Ark.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Ms. Hamers regarding:  • whether there were size recommendations or standards that exist  amongst zoos for space or enclosures for animals;  • whether the property could properly accommodate the number of  animals at Nova's Ark;  • whether Ms. Hamers has visited Nova's Ark;  • whether there was an accreditation that World Animal Protection  provides to organizations like Nova's Ark;  • clarification on the key concerns of World Animal Protection with  respect to the property and animals at Nova's Ark and whether  there was a way to address the concerns raised by World Animal  Protection through the implementation of requirements in order to   allow Nova's Ark to continue.      2.9  Rob Laidlaw representing Zoocheck Inc.  Re: Legal and Enforcement Services Report, LS 16-21  Prohibited & Regulated Animals By-law Exemption Request for Nova's  Ark – 7505 Cedarbrook Trail     Refer to Item 4.7, LS 16-21  Rob Laidlaw, representing Zoocheck Inc., stated that he was the  Director of Zoocheck Inc. and a chartered biologist. Mr. Laidlaw advised  that since 1979 he has been professionally engaged in work regarding  the keeping of wildlife in captivity, wildlife conservation, and animal  welfare including assessments of hundreds of different types of facilities.  He stated that he was supportive of programs and activities that provide  benefits to vulnerable people, but that he was not supportive when  vulnerable people were put in situations of unnecessary risk, often  without them knowing, or when animal welfare was jeopardized. Mr.  Laidlaw advised that he reviewed the Staff report and the accompanying  animal inventory list. He stated that the animal inventory list contained a  number of wild exotic animals including the wolves, the bobcat, the lynx,  the caracal, giant constricting snakes, the serval, kinkajous and primates  that were considered dangerous or pose meaningful substantive risks to  people by professional zoos, sanctuaries, and a multitude of laws and  regulations in Canada. He stated that these animals were prohibited  from private possession primarily for safety reasons in most Canadian  provinces and over 200 municipalities in Ontario. Mr. Laidlaw advised  that the danger that some animals pose was often overlooked, but they  were well illustrated by past incidents. He provided examples of  Page 13 of 27  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 27, 2021 - 7:00 PM    incidents which have taken involving wolves, a camel and lemurs. He  stated that even when highly trained staff and all possible safeguards  were in place direct interaction with potentially dangerous animals was  never safe and there was no guarantee that it could be safe because the  activity itself was inherently risky. He further stated that often the  damage that could be done by animals was unexpected and could occur  in a blink of an eye before even a trained professional could act. Mr.  Laidlaw advised that exposing potentially dangerous wild animals to  members of the public was unnecessary, noting that most professional  accredited animal assisted therapy takes place with highly trained dogs,  horses and other domesticated animals, which was advocated for by  professional organizations. He stated that Nova's Ark could achieve its  goals without exposing anyone to unnecessary risks, noting that there  were a multitude of domesticated animal species that would be more  suitable for interactions. He further stated there were literally thousands  of non-prohibited species available that were far less risky and in some  cases easier to take care of should Nova's Ark want to continue with  exotic wild animals. Mr. Laidlaw stated that he was concerned about  vulnerable children and adults that may not know that they were being  exposed to risk. He urged Members of Committee to act on Option # 3  in Staff Report LS 16-21 that would deny the request for an exemption,  noting that Nova's Ark could continue with a more manageable and safe  compliment of animals and ensure that human health and safety was  enhanced and animal welfare better served. Mr. Laidlaw commented  that the reason that Nova's Ark may be characterized as unique was not  about what was stated previously, but because very few if anybody else  in Canada takes those risks.  A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Mr. Laidlaw regarding the details about the incident that  occurred at the Haliburton Wolf Centre.  It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 4.7, LS 16-21, at  this time.    3.

The application is for permission to:  1. reduce the minimum dwelling unit area from 56 square metres to 48 square  metres;  2. exempt the subject property from part of provision 25(107)(c) which requires that  one (1) temporary parking space shall be located at or near the southerly  entrance of the buildings; and  3. reduce the minimum side yard setback to a parking area from 1.9 metres to 1.0  metre.  The subject property is located at 840 Dundas St E and is zoned R5 (Residential Type 5  Zone), subject to a site specific zoning exception (provision 25(107)(c)) in Zoning By-law 2585.  In Support of Application  Paul Owie     (Applicants Architect)    Jules Paolozza (Agent)  In Opposition of Application      Marilyn Horwood     (Resident)  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  P. Owie introduced himself to the Committee as the                 applicants Architect and     provided  an overview of the requested variances.            J. Paolozza introduced himself to the Committee as             the applicant, and representative     of  STETO Camp     Holdings Ltd.    The Chair asked if there were any questions of the Committee.  S. Haslam asked the applicant if they            read the Staff     Report and     comments provided by  the Central Lake Ontario Conservation Authority (CLOCA).          P. Owie replied that the Staff Report was not                 read, but     he was aware       of the comments  provided by the Conservation Authority         to remove the       proposed parking     spaces from      the north west corner of         the subject property.      J. Paolozza asked the Committee why parking           cannot be located     at the     north west      corner of the       site as is being      proposed.  J. Malfara replied that as per the comments               received by     the Conservation Authority, the      proposed parking     encroaches into the existing floodplain           limit.  Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment                                                                                         B. O'Carroll asked what currently     exists at in      the north     west portion     of the site.    P. Owie replied that the area is vacant land.               B. O'Carroll inquired about     the dwelling unit     make-up within the       existing apartment      buildings.  P. Owie advised the Committee that the             majority of units within       the existing apartment        buildings are comprised of two           bedroom apartment dwellings.    B. O'Carroll asked it the parking       that currently exists on       the site     is sufficient     for the  number of units.      J. Paolozza replied that the       existing parking is sufficient.        J. Paolozza also advised that  there is a surplus of parking spaces,            as many of       the residents are elderly     and take      public transit which is located on Dundas              Street East.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application. There was none.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.  M. Horwood introduced herself to the       Committee as a 25 year resident     of the     existing  apartment complex. M. Horwood advised           the Committee that       there are 2    locker rooms  in the     lower level of each apartment building and             that the former     owners attempted to      evict residents     from their locker       spaces. It was expressed by          M. Horwood     that the      tenants appealed the former owners           decision to the       Landlord and Tennant Board       where  the eviction proposed by the       landlord was repealed.    M. Horwood acknowledged that     the 2 proposed apartment       units will be     located within      the existing locker rooms.  M. Horwood advised that     she would like the         applicant to     implement a    temporary parking  space at the front of the buildings               before the entry arches         nearest to Dundas       Street  East.  M. Horwood also advised     the Committee of       garbage accumulating at the rear     of the      property and if a fenced         garbage enclosure or any         other measures can be implemented        to rectify the matter.      J. Paolozza replied to the Committee         in response to     the comments     provided by     M.  Horwood that a temporary parking space            located at the     front of     the property     is  unfeasible and     would pose a      safety hazard     if required.     Due to the sloping grade     towards  Dundas Street East, the angle           of a temporary parking space          in conjunction     with the      proximity to the street may increase the               chance of a    collision with vehicles     turning into  the site from Dundas Street East.        J. Taylor noted that if the applicant cannot              satisfy CLOCA with       respect to the     location of      the proposed parking, the       applicant will have to         add an additional     variance with respect        Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            to the minimum amount     of parking on site. If a further variance is required,                the revised      minor variance application will have to be               recirculated.  Moved by: B. O'Carroll  That the application to 1) to reduce the minimum dwelling unit area from 56 square  meters to 48 square metres, 2) to exempt the subject property from part of provision  25(107)(c) which requires that one (1) temporary parking space shall be located at or  near the southerly entrance of the buildings, and 3) to reduce the minimum side yard  setback to a parking area from 1.9 metres to 1.0 metre. located at 840 Dundas St E be  TABLED until the March 1, 2018 meeting or until such time that CLOCA is satisfied with  the proposed parking configuration.

The  detached garage     will be used     to park his       automobiles, boat, and other       recreational  vehicles. T.     Small advised     the Committee     that his home does     not currently contain     an  enclosed garage to       park any of his vehicles.          B. Little introduced     himself to the Committee as           the owners father-in-law     and advised      that he     read the Staff Report. B. Little expressed that                 the applicant     has worked with        Staff and reduced the size of             the detached garage from       what was originally     proposed.  B. Little noted     that he is      aware of the     comments provided by the Town     of Whitby     Public  Works Department not supporting the         application until a    storm water management     brief  is submitted and       approved by the     Works Department.     He noted that the       proposed  asphalt driveway will be replaced           with a permeable paver       surface to allow       drainage.  B. Little advised     the Committee     that a storm water        management brief has       been  prepared by a      professional Engineer confirming that         the proposal will     not have     any  adverse storm water impacts         on the surrounding properties.     B. Little provided     the  Committee with a copy of the            storm water management brief.        B. Little requested     that the Committee     approve the     variances subject to       the approval     of  the storm water management brief by           the Town of Whitby     Public Works     Department  prior to the       issuance of any     building permit for the     proposed detached garage.      The Chair asked if there were any questions of the Committee.  Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      S. Haslam asked B. Little if the            storm water     management brief was     submitted to the        Public Works Department.    B. Little replied that the         report was recently finalized         and a    copy will     be forwarded to       the  Public Works Department shortly.      J. Cardwell asked B. Little         if a building permit has          been applied     for.  B. Little replied that a building permit application has                yet to be       applied for.  B. O'Carroll asked if the proposed driveway will maintain the               minimum setback from     the  south property line.      J. Taylor replied that       based on the       submitted Site Plan, the         driveway maintains a 0.60m  setback to the lot         line which complies       with the     requirements of the     Zoning By-law.  J. Cardwell asked the applicant if the building will                contain a    second storey loft.  T. Small replied that a        loft is proposed within the          second storey of the     detached garage,  but this area will only be used for storage.              The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application. There was none.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.  Moved by: J. Cardwell  That the application to increase the maximum permitted lot coverage of an accessory  structure (detached garage) from 50% of the main dwelling (47.38 square metres) to  95% of the main dwelling (90 square metres) located at 908 Donovan Cres be  GRANTED subject to the following condition:  1. A building permit shall not be issued until such                   time the storm     water management      brief is approved by        the Town     of Whitby Public Works         Department.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of               the opinion that       the variance     is  minor in    nature; that     the general intent and       purpose of the       By-law and the      Official Plan is being        maintained, and further       that the granting of       the  application is desirable      and would result       in the     appropriate development     of  the property.    Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.  Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment                                                                                                                                                                                            Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/06/18  Maurice King   Queen Street (Part 1, Plan 40R-8914)   An application has been received from Maurice King for a variance from the provisions  of By-Law 1784.  The application is for permission to:  1. increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 20% to 35%; and  2. increase to maximum permitted building height from 8.5m to 9.0m.  The subject property is located on Queen Street (Part 1, Plan 40R-8914) and is zoned  R3-BP (Residential Type 3 – Brooklin Plan).  In Support of Application   Maurice King (Agent)  In Opposition of Application        Doug Derry    Bruno Santos    Yvone Fernandes  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  M. King introduced himself to the           Committee as the Agent     representing the     owner of the        property. M. King       advised the Committee     that he is aware of concerns     regarding the      proposed building     coverage by     local residents     in attendance at     this meeting. M. King  clarified that the       proposed coverage     of 35% is not only       the proposed     dwelling, but     also  includes the floor area of a            proposed shed/pool cabana       and three car       garage.  J. Taylor provided clarification that in this situation the                lot coverage includes the      coverage of the proposed         dwelling and any       accessory structures.  M. King advised that the proposed dwelling             was perceived by     Planning Staff as     being  1.5 storeys in    height, but     the home is only        1 storey     and there will     be no living     space  above the main floor.        M. King expressed that       the proposed height     variance is    required to accommodate     the  proposed roof pitch in accordance with the architectural                guidelines of the     subdivision to      the east. The increase in the          building height also permits         greater floor to     ceiling heights  which is representative of modern design trends.             M. King confirmed     that he     has read the       Staff Report and is    aware of     the comments      provided by the Public Works Department as they pertain                 to storm     water management.    Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment                                                                                                                                                 M. King advised the Committee that Biddle and Associates                 (Engineering Consultant)      has been retained       to review the storm water management           on the property. Permeable  pavers are being considered         for the driveway       surface as     well as     an infiltration trench.  M. King requested that the Committee approve the variance                 conditional upon     the  satisfaction of the Town of Whitby Public               Works Department.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application. There was none.  The Chair asked if there were any questions of the Committee.  B. O'Carroll asked the applicant if the minimum required            40% front yard landscaped      area will be       achieved with the       proposed driveway configuration.      M. King confirmed     that a minimum of        40% front yard landscaped area     will be     achieved.  J. Taylor expressed to the Committee and             the applicant     that a    maximum driveway     width  of 9.0m is permitted for a dwelling containing a three                car garage.     Should the     applicant  wish to expand       the driveway beyond       9.0m, a further     variance will be required.  B. O'Carroll asked the applicant if any        trees are to       be removed.  M. King replied that the proposed configuration of the                 house and driveway     will  necessitate the removal of some           existing trees along the     frontage of     the property.    S. Haslam asked the applicant if a           draft storm water management         report has been        prepared.  M. King replied that a report          has not yet been prepared, however an engineering        consultant has     been retained.    The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.  D. Derry introduced himself to         the Committee     and advised     that he is    not in support     of  the proposed development, or variances. D. Derry noted               that he is the      owner of the      neighbouring property to the         north and the siting         of the     proposed dwelling will     obstruct  the views from his south facing           bay window.  D. Derry advised the Committee that           the proposed building       height is    excessively tall and      will deter from the community character.            J. Cardwell asked Staff if        9.0m building heights     have been     granted elsewhere in the      community.  J. Taylor responded that 9.0m         building heights have     been granted by     the Committee  within the neighbourhood.      The Chair asked the applicant if the house were to be mirrored would there be any  benefit to D. Derry.  Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment                                                                                                                                                                                                                               M. King replied that mirroring the house             and shifting     the driveway to     the south     side of  the property will have no         benefit to the neighbouring property to             the north. In     fact, this  option may     be less     desirable.  B. O'Carroll advised D. Derry that         the minimum side yard setback         will be achieved     and  the distance between his bay         window and the proposed     dwelling is permitted as     of right.    Y. Fernandes introduced herself to the Committee as               a local resident residing at 25  Corvinelli Drive.      Y. Fernandes asked the       applicant if the     proposed garage can be  shifted southward.    M. King advised that shifting the           garage further south will have     no benefit to       the  neighbours.  B. Santos introduced himself to the       Committee as a local resident residing at     25  Corvinelli Drive. B.       Santos asked     the applicant if      the proposed     dwelling will project     past  the minimum rear yard setback.        J. Taylor replied that       the proposed dwelling can be           built up to the     minimum rear     yard  setback subject to meeting other provisions of               the By-law.     Based on the       applicants  current plans, no variance is required            to the rear yard     setback.  The Chair asked if there were any further questions. There was none.  Moved by: S. Haslam  That the application to 1) to increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 20% to  35%; and 2) to increase to maximum permitted building height from 8.5m to 9.0m.  located at Queen Street (Part 1, Plan 40R-8914) be TABLED until the March 1, 2018  meeting or until such time that the applicant can satisfy the Public Works Department  that any additional storm water can be managed within the subject property.  Carried  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.  Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment                 Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/07/18  E. Herbert Weston  850 Cochrane St  An application has been received from E. Herbert Weston for a variance from  the provisions of By-Law 1784.  The application is for permission to reduce the minimum required front yard setback  from 12.00 metres to 10.25 metres.   The subject property is located at 850 Cochrane St and is zoned R1 (First Density   Residential Zone).   In Support of Application  Herb Weston (Owner)   In Opposition of Application  None at this time.   The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the   subject application.   H. Weston introduced himself to the Committee as the owner of the subject property  and advised that he is proposing to construct a new garage extension to his home as  well as a covered front porch. H. Weston expressed to the Committee that the Region of  Durham expropriated a portion of his lot frontage for the purpose of a road widening a  number of years ago. As a result of the expropriation, the minimum front yard setback to  the proposed porch is not achieved.  The Chair asked if there were any questions of the Committee.  The Chair asked the applicant to clarify where the garage expansion is to occur.  H. Weston advised the Committee that the existing two car garage will be converted to  living space and a new two car garage will be constructed adjacent to the north side of  the existing dwelling.  S. Haslam asked the applicant if he read the Staff Report.  H. Weston replied that he did not.  H. Weston asked the Committee if he is subject to the 20 day statutory appeal period.  J. Taylor advised the applicant that should the Committee approve the proposed  variance the variance will be final and binding following the 20 day appeal period,  subject to no appeals being received.  The Chair asked if there were any further questions. There was none.

Planning and Development     Page 1 of 15  Committee of the Whole Minutes   December 02, 2019 - 7:00 PM    Councillor Roy assumed the Chair.  1.  Presentations    1.1  There were no presentations.    2.  Delegations    2.1  Dave Kelly  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 96-19  Zoning By-law Amendment Application, 143 Garrard Road, Toronto- Guild Investments Ltd., File DEV-01-18 (Z-02-18)    Refer to Item 4.1, PL 96-19  Dave Kelly, 153 Garrard Road, appeared before Committee and advised  that his objection to the application was related to the entrance to the  proposed development. He stated that the layout of the complex would  allow for a connection onto the future extension to Manning Road at the  east end of the subject property. He inquired whether it would be better  for the Town, the Region, and the developer to construct the first portion  of the Manning Road extension and make an intersection at Garrard  Road and Manning Road. He further inquired about the cost of the  temporary interim access road in comparison to the cost associated with  property damage or personal injury.   A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Mr. Kelly regarding:  • clarification on the construction of the Manning Road extension;  and,  • whether the primary concerns of the delegate were access and  traffic.      2.2  Steve Konoby  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 96-19  Zoning By-law Amendment Application, 143 Garrard Road, Toronto- Guild Investments Ltd., File DEV-01-18 (Z-02-18)    Refer to Item 4.1, PL 96-19  Steve Konoby, 151 Garrard Road, appeared before Committee and  raised concerns regarding traffic and safety. He advised that he had  reviewed the Traffic Impact Study, and noted that the study meets the  criteria for this type of development and that Garrard Road could handle  the increase of traffic. He stated that the study did not mention the flow  Page 2 of 15  Committee of the Whole Minutes   December 02, 2019 - 7:00 PM    of traffic during certain times of the day or the crosswalks located on  Manning Road and Garrard Road for Dr. Robert Thornton Public School  and St. Paul Catholic School. He noted that a by-law prohibiting on- street parking near Dr. Robert Thornton Public School was passed a  couple of years ago which has resulted in more students walking to  school. He referenced photographs, previously submitted to the Office of  the Town Clerk, that he took from his driveway after children were in  school, noting the number of vehicles that were backed up from the  intersection of Garrard Road and Manning Road. Mr. Konoby raised  concerns about the traffic impact of an additional 20 to 40 cars exiting  from the proposed development and the safety of pedestrians walking to  and from school. He stated that the report indicated that the proposed  development would not set a precedent and would exist in harmony with  the existing neighbourhood, and inquired when and where in Whitby  homes have been permitted to be built sideways beside existing houses.  He expressed concerns about the lack of communication and  engagement by the developer with the neighbours and Members of  Council. He stated that many of the residents were not opposed to  development, but that they wanted less density and less intensification  in order for the development to be compatible with the neighbourhood.  He noted that the original proposal and subsequent revisions to the  proposal were all recommended for approval by staff, and that this has  led residents to believe that development would occur and that the only  question was about the number of units that would be built. He urged  the Committee not to approve the development in its current form.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Mr. Konoby regarding:  • the timing of the Traffic Impact Study;  • whether there had been engagement by the applicant with  residents in the area;  • environmental concerns and the impact to wildlife in the area;   • the possibility of an alternate entry and exit to and from the  proposed development to reduce traffic congestion;   • the compatibility of the development with the current  neighbourhood; and,  • traffic and pedestrian safety concerns.      2.3  Tracy Murray  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 96-19  Zoning By-law Amendment Application, 143 Garrard Road, Toronto- Guild Investments Ltd., File DEV-01-18 (Z-02-18)    Refer to Item 4.1, PL 96-19  Page 3 of 15  Committee of the Whole Minutes   December 02, 2019 - 7:00 PM    Tracy Murray, 151 Garrard Road, appeared before Committee and  advised that her property was located adjacent to the proposed  development. She stated that she and residents in the area were  opposed to the proposed development and requested that the  Committee deny the application. She further stated that over 100  residents attended previous meetings, that there were 34 written  submissions, as well as a petition with 147 signatures submitted to the  Town. She commented on the developer not listening to the  community's request for detached homes or concerns about traffic and  over intensification, noting that the number of townhouses had only  been reduced by two. She noted that a number of residents were not in  attendance at this meeting as they felt the concerns raised by the public  were not being taken seriously by the developer. Ms. Murray advised  that she would still like to see an alternate entrance and exit to and from  the development. She suggested that the developer should be  responsible for creating an alternate entrance/exit at the intersection of  Manning Road and Garrard Road, noting that constructing a temporary  road would increase public safety and reduce traffic concerns. She  commented on the over intensification of land regulated by the Central  Lake Ontario Conservation Authority and designated by Whitby's Official  Plan as major open space, and stated that development should not take  place on these lands. Ms. Murray advised that she had previously  requested that a wooden fence be installed on the north side of the  subject property, but that she had not heard or seen any documentation  about a timeline associated with the construction of the fence. She  requested that either staff or the developer contact her and her adjoining  neighbours directly regarding the installation of the fence. She further  advised that 50 trees and shrubs would be removed from the property  and requested that tree replacement be required. Ms. Murray inquired  about garbage disposal, storage and collection, the type and style of  street lighting that would be used, whether the lights would be on all the  time, and mitigation of light pollution for surrounding neighbours. She  mentioned the wildlife in her back yard and in the neighbourhood, noting  that a representative for the development previously spoke about  minimizing environmental impact, but failed to mention the barn  swallows and bats found in the Environmental Impact Study.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Ms. Murray regarding:  • whether a second access point would be acceptable should the  application be approved; and,  • traffic and safety concerns.      2.4  Peter VanderZwet  Page 4 of 15  Committee of the Whole Minutes   December 02, 2019 - 7:00 PM    Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 96-19  Zoning By-law Amendment Application, 143 Garrard Road, Toronto- Guild Investments Ltd., File DEV-01-18 (Z-02-18)    Refer to Item 4.1, PL 96-19  Peter VanderZwet, 184 Garrard Street, appeared before Committee and  stated that the Committee should not permit development on the  property. He advised that he had to widen his driveway in order to turn  his vehicle around to access Garrard Road as it was impossible to back  out of his driveway due to traffic congestion. He stated that he has  witnessed as many as 50 vehicles backed up on Garrard Road and has  counted as many as 100 vehicles pass by his property in a 15 minute  period. Mr. VanderZwet inquired about the time of day the Traffic Impact  Study was undertaken. He stated that future development at the  northwest corner of Taunton Road and Garrard Road as well as this  development would exacerbate traffic congestion on Garrard Road.  A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Mr. VanderZwet regarding whether the extension of  Manning Road to Adelaide Avenue would improve traffic congestion and  the impact that the noise from air conditioners would have on  neighbours.      2.5  Kevin and Sheila Lees  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 96-19  Zoning By-law Amendment Application, 143 Garrard Road, Toronto- Guild Investments Ltd., File DEV-01-18 (Z-02-18)     Refer to Item 4.1, PL 96-19  Kevin and Sheila Lees, 18 Burnage Lane, appeared before Committee  and stated that the extension of Manning Road to Adelaide Avenue  should be completed for the purpose of emergency vehicle access, but  that there should not be development on the extension. Mr. Lees stated  that there was enough intensification occurring in Whitby and that the  subject property should not be developed.  A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Mr. and Mrs. Lees regarding traffic on Garrard Road.      2.6  Natalie Afonso  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 96-19  Zoning By-law Amendment Application, 143 Garrard Road, Toronto- Guild Investments Ltd., File DEV-01-18 (Z-02-18)  Page 5 of 15  Committee of the Whole Minutes   December 02, 2019 - 7:00 PM       Refer to Item 4.1, PL 96-19  When called upon, Ms. Afonso was not in attendance to make a  delegation to the Committee.      2.7  Mark Janzen and Joe Costa representing Toronto-Guild Investments  Limited  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 96-19  Zoning By-law Amendment Application, 143 Garrard Road, Toronto- Guild Investments Ltd., File DEV-01-18 (Z-02-18)     Refer to Item 4.1, PL 96-19  Mark Janzen and Joe Costa, representing Toronto-Guild Investments  Limited, appeared before Committee to answer questions regarding:  • the rationale for not holding a community meeting;  • revisions made to the proposal including increasing the number  of semi-detached dwelling units and reducing the number of block  townhouse dwelling units;  • fencing and the berm on the north side of the property;  • mitigation measures to address environmental and wildlife  impacts;  • the timing and results of the Traffic Signal Warrant Study at  Garrard Road and Manning Road;  • the results of the Traffic Impact Study, the Environmental Impact  Study, and the Noise Assessment;  • details related to right-in/right-out access to the development as  part of the Manning Road to Adelaide Avenue connection;   • whether there was a willingness to meet with area residents to  address their concerns; and,  • whether the proponent was in support of the interim temporary  access road.  It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 4.1, PL 96-19, at  this time.      2.8  Marilyn Oates  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 91-19  DEV-04-17, Draft Plan of Subdivision Application SW-2017-08 and  Zoning By-law Amendment Application Z-19-17, Winash Developments  Limited, 5550 Baldwin Street South and a Portion of 145 Winchester  Road West    Page 6 of 15  Committee of the Whole Minutes   December 02, 2019 - 7:00 PM    Refer to Item 4.2, PL 91-19  Marilyn Oates, 27 Watford Street, appeared before Committee and  raised concerns regarding the spruce trees on the Ministry of  Transportation (MTO) land located at the southwest corner of  Winchester Road and Baldwin Street. She advised that the spruce trees  were planted in the 1940s by children who were members of the 4-H  Club. She stated that the trees were a heritage feature in Brooklin. She  further stated that she wanted to ensure that the trees were inventoried  and preserved. Ms. Oates suggested incorporating the trees into the  development by way of a path through the trees and to include a  historical plaque explaining their significance. She commented on the  opportunity for the MTO, the developer and the Town to promote the  history of the Town and their dedication to the natural environment by  recognizing that trees, as well as buildings, have historical and heritage  significance.    A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Ms. Oates regarding the type, location, and number of  trees.      2.9  Jason Naagel  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 91-19  DEV-04-17, Draft Plan of Subdivision Application SW-2017-08 and  Zoning By-law Amendment Application Z-19-17, Winash Developments  Limited, 5550 Baldwin Street South and a Portion of 145 Winchester  Road West     Refer to Item 4.2, PL 91-19  Jason Naagel, 23 Ferguson Avenue, appeared before Committee and  stated that he was not opposed to the development, but that he was  concerned about the traffic impact that the development would have on  Ferguson Avenue. He provided detailed information regarding  communication over the past year with Members of Council and Town  Staff with respect the 2016 Environmental Assessment (EA) for  Ferguson Avenue. He stated that the EA would ultimately inform the  design of the intersection of Ferguson Avenue and Highway 7. Mr.  Naagel noted that his purpose in attending Committee meetings was to  try to influence the design so that there were fewer vehicles travelling on  Ferguson Avenue, and to request measures to restrict cut-through  traffic. He advised that correspondence from the Town regarding this  matter described a restricted signalization which would prevent  southbound and northbound movements through the intersection, but  that it did not mention the prevention of left-hand turns from southbound  traffic on Ferguson Avenue. He further advised that the correspondence  Page 7 of 15  Committee of the Whole Minutes   December 02, 2019 - 7:00 PM    indicated that the intersection proposal was to be incorporated into the  evaluation options for Ferguson Avenue and would be presented for  discussion at a Public Information Centre (PIC) in the fall of 2019. Mr.  Naagel advised that since he had not received notification for the PIC,  he contacted Town Staff who advised that it had been postponed until  2020. He stated that he received the notice for the Staff Report PL 91- 19, and noted that report referenced right-in/right-out access on  Ferguson Avenue, as well as noting that the distances between  intersections and the spacing of intersections would not be consistent  with policy. He stated that he believed that the proposal for the restricted  signalization at Ferguson Avenue and Highway 7 should be rejected.  The report also indicated that the EA for Ferguson Avenue was ongoing  and that there was still a potential for a partial or full closure of Ferguson  Avenue. Mr. Naagel further inquired whether an alternate proposal for  the closure of Ferguson Avenue could be submitted should the proposal  for restricted signalization be rejected.      2.10 Andy Barrington  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 91-19  DEV-04-17, Draft Plan of Subdivision Application SW-2017-08 and  Zoning By-law Amendment Application Z-19-17, Winash Developments  Limited, 5550 Baldwin Street South and a Portion of 145 Winchester  Road West    Refer to Item 4.2, PL 91-19  Andy Barrington, 25 Ferguson Avenue, appeared before Committee and  stated that his concerns were similar to those expressed by the previous  delegate. He advised that he was opposed to the approval of the Draft  Plan of Subdivision because the plan failed to address traffic concerns  on Ferguson Avenue. He noted that the report did not mention how  southbound traffic on Ferguson Avenue would be addressed and that  the MTO has only agreed in principle to reduced access from  Winchester Road for northbound traffic on Ferguson Avenue. Mr.  Barrington further noted that the restricted signalization was not  referenced within the report, that the Ferguson Avenue EA was not  complete, and that it appeared as though the Town was relying on the  MTO to develop a solution. He requested that the Committee deny the  approval of the Draft Plan of Subdivision.      2.11 Bryce Jordan representing Winash Developments (Fieldgate)  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 91-19  DEV-04-17, Draft Plan of Subdivision Application SW-2017-08 and  Zoning By-law Amendment Application Z-19-17, Winash Developments  Limited, 5550 Baldwin Street South and a Portion of 145 Winchester  Page 8 of 15  Committee of the Whole Minutes   December 02, 2019 - 7:00 PM    Road West    Refer to Item 4.2, PL 91-19  Bryce Jordan, representing Winash Developments (Fieldgate),  appeared before Committee and commented on working with the MTO,  noting that the MTO had indicated that any communication from the  developer should take place via the Planning and Development  Department. He advised that the proponent and Town Staff have been  able to coordinate efforts to deal with matters of drainage which were  necessary prior to zoning by-law amendment approval and that they  would continue to work with staff. He noted that the trees mentioned by  a previous delegate belong to the MTO and that decisions could not be  made with respect to those trees at this time. Mr. Jordan advised that  obtaining draft approval was essential to continue to move forward with  this project. He further advised that the MTO has verbally agreed to  restricted access with signalization at Ferguson Avenue and Winchester  Road, noting that his clients road would align with Ferguson Avenue, but  would not contribute to traffic going north/south on Ferguson Avenue  should that option be selected through the EA. Mr. Jordan requested the  Committee approve the Draft Plan of Subdivision.    3.  Correspondence    3.1  There was no correspondence.    4.  Staff Reports    4.1  Planning and Development Department Report, PL 96-19  Re: Zoning By-law Amendment Application, 143 Garrard Road, Toronto- Guild Investments Ltd., File DEV-01-18 (Z-02-18)  A detailed question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Staff regarding:  • whether staff recommend a temporary interim access road via the  Region's right-of-way connecting to the intersection of Manning  Road and Garrard Road and whether the cost of the temporary  interim access road would be considered significant relative to  the profitability of the project;   • the timeline associated with the Manning Road to Adelaide  Avenue extension;  • how the Region would monitor the need for traffic signals at the  intersection of Garrard Road and Manning Road and the timeline  for the installation of traffic signals once the need was  established;  Page 9 of 15  Committee of the Whole Minutes   December 02, 2019 - 7:00 PM    • the timeline for construction of the wooden fence along the north  side of the site;  • whether the Town has control over design elements associated  with the proposed development;  • whether trees removed from the site would be replaced;  • the type of street lighting;  • existing developments in Whitby similar to the proposed  development and whether the proposed development would set a  precedent for future development in the area;  • details surrounding the construction of the right-in/right-out  access to the site from Garrard Road and the possibility of  creating a turning lane into the site;  • whether an increase in traffic was anticipated on Garrard Road  and on Thornton Road following the Dryden Boulevard  connection and whether this was considered as part of the Traffic  Impact Study;  • the timing for completion of the proposed development and timing  of the Manning Road to Adelaide Avenue extension;  • the possibility of U-turns occurring on Garrard Road and nearby  streets due to the future right-in/right-out access on Garrard  Road; and,  • clarification about warranted versus unwarranted traffic  signalization at the intersection of Manning Road and Garrard  Road.      Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Alexander    1. That Council approve an amendment to Zoning By-law # 1784  (application Z-02-18) subject to the conditions contained in  Report PL 96-19;   2. That a Zoning By-law Amendment be brought forward for  consideration by Council;  3. That a future right-in/right-out access to the Manning Road- Adelaide Avenue extension be required in conjunction with the  design and construction of the new Regional road; and,  4. That item MD-4834 be removed from the New and Unfinished  Business List.    Motion Lost    Note:  Further to Item 5.1, the disposition of this matter was  determined through the following motion.  Page 10 of 15  Committee of the Whole Minutes   December 02, 2019 - 7:00 PM      Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Shahid    That the amendment to Zoning By-law # 1784 for 143 Garrard Road be  denied.    Carried    It was the consensus of the Committee to take a short recess.

Mar, Commissioner of Legal and By-law Services/Town Solicitor  J. Taylor, Manager of Planning Administration  C. Harris, Town Clerk   C. Bantock, Legislative Coordinator    Regrets:  None noted    1.  Declarations of Pecuniary Interest    1.1  There were no declarations of pecuniary interest.    2.  Presentations    2.1  Kevin Narraway, Manager of By-law and Animal Services, and Alex  Lam, Manager of Development Engineering  Re: Public Works Department and Legal and By-law Services  Department Joint Report, PW 07-17  Site Alteration By-law  Kevin Narraway, Manager of By-law and Animal Services, and Alex  Lam, Manager of Development Engineering, appeared before Council  and stated that staff conducted consultations with stakeholders  regarding the Site Alteration By-law following direction provided by  Council at the January 23, 2017 Operations Committee meeting. Mr.  Narraway stated that the majority of the feedback received through this   Special Council Minutes   April 03, 2017 - 6:00 PM    consultation process has been for the Town to provide stricter  regulations and increase environmental protection. Mr. Narraway  provided an overview of the steps taken to date in the process as well  as highlights of the main differences between the current draft and the  previous version. Mr. Narraway provided the following five areas of  concern as addressed by the draft Site Alteration By-law:  • mitigate drainage impacts;  • environmental concerns;  • mitigate potential nuisance impacts  • fair compensation mechanisms; and,  • compliance with the Town's Zoning By-law.    3.  Delegations    3.1  Barry Harding, Nick Aprile, Andy Fawcett and Wayne Bruce  representing Durham Region Heavy Contractors Association  Re: Public Works Department and Legal and By-law Services  Department Joint Report, PW 07-17  Site Alteration By-law  Andy Fawcett and Wayne Bruce, representing Durham Region Heavy  Contractors Association, appeared before Council and stated as  contractors they are creating excess soil and need a place to dispose of  such soil; however, this is not easy for a number of reasons. They  advised that the difficulty with the proposed draft by-law is cost certainty  and that the road damage fee complicates this further because it is not  clear how damage is determined and what the associated costs may be  for repairs. They stated that they were amenable to the proposed two  dollar per cubic meter fee but that contractors with fill disposal sites  outside of Durham Region will have an advantage as they will not have  to pay the two dollar fee for both removal and dumping. Further  concerns were raised by the Durham Region Heavy Contractors  Association with regard to onerous peer review requirements, permits  being for a maximum of two years, and the length and complexity of the  proposed guidelines.   A question and answer period ensued between Members of Council and  the delegates with respect to:  • nuisance regulation concerns previously raised (e.g. dust and  mud) being resolved in the revised draft by-law;  • concerns with length and complexity of the guidelines but not the  by-law;  • the guidelines being a working document open to ongoing  dialogue between Staff and stakeholders;  • opportunities to investigate financial securities other than the non- Page 2 of 6  Special Council Minutes   April 03, 2017 - 6:00 PM    refundable deposits being recommended;  • whether the by-law diverged from best practices and regulations  imposed by other jurisdictions; and,  • how road damage fees would be determined.      3.2  Jane Ling  Re: Public Works Department and Legal and By-law Services  Department Joint Report, PW 07-17  Site Alteration By-law    Jane Ling, 535 Myrtle Road West, Ashburn, appeared before Council  and stated she currently serves as the Ashburn Neighborhood Watch  Chair person and is a member of the Ashburn Community Centre Board.  Ms. Ling stated that Ashburn has been invaded by dump trucks and she  has received many emails and phone calls from other residents who are  concerned about the volume, disruption, and long term environmental  impact of the dumping. Ms. Ling further stated that north Whitby is  becoming a hot spot to dump fill and there needs to be increased  protection of community residents. She advised that she feels the new  by-law is fair and appropriate and supports the implementation of the by- law before April 30th when axle weight restrictions are removed.      3.3  Robert Nixon  Re: Public Works Department and Legal and By-law Services  Department Joint Report, PW 07-17  Site Alteration By-law   Robert Nixon, Ashburn resident, appeared before Council and stated  that the community in Ashburn is still very much rural and farm lands.  Mr. Nixon stated that most residents get their water from private wells  and the influx of fill is threatening this source of water. He further stated  that the proposed by-law will be effective in providing oversight in the  future and that he is fully supportive and looks forward to the  implementation prior to the working season.    4.  Items for Consideration    4.1  Public Works Department and Legal and By-law Services Department  Joint Report, PW 07-17  Re: Site Alteration By-law  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Council and  Staff with respect to:  • the type of projects that fall within the scoped exemptions  provided for in the by-law;  Page 3 of 6  Special Council Minutes   April 03, 2017 - 6:00 PM    • the increased fees proposed as part of the draft by-law;  • the opportunity for staff to provide contractors with costs for  potential road damage repair in advance of a permit being issued;  • the start date of a permit being tied to confirmation of fill  operations proceeding;  • investigating the use of insured bonds as a financial security;  • the guidelines being adjusted to more clearly define adjacent  property references in the by-law;  • concerns related to water quality and proposed requirements to  test ground water on properties adjacent to fill operations;  • whether future fill permits adjacent to Townline Road would be  permitted due to the boundary road's condition;  • relying on professionals to perform peer reviewed environmental  measurements and testing;  • the intent to continue consultations with stakeholders and further  clarify the guidelines as necessary;  • the permit length of 24 months being a benefit to ensure finite  timelines;  • fill control regulations imposed by surrounding municipalities;  • fill for closure and removal of swimming pools being exempt from  the by-law; and,  • staff reporting back on the use of insured bonds compared to  non-refundable deposits.      Resolution # 179-17    Moved By Councillor Leahy  Seconded By Councillor Emm    1. That Report PW 07-17 be received for information;  2.

She raised concerns regarding the heritage status of her property and  what building standards would be considered in order to mitigate  damage to her property. She raised a concern related to privacy and  how she would lose her privacy once the buildings are constructed. She  indicated that the garbage dumpster for the site should be in a different  location as it was facing her property at the moment.  Kirk LeReverend, 61 Matthewson Place, asked if garbage pickup would  be provided by the municipality. He also asked if it was possible to  conduct a vibration test prior to and after construction to assess the  condition of his home to see if damage had occurred during  construction. He raised concerns related to noise, quiet enjoyment, and  how his property value will be affected.

Planning and Development Department Report, PL 14-19  Re: Applications for Official Plan Amendment, Draft Plan of Subdivision,  and Zoning By-Law Amendment for 4335 Garden Street, by Signature  4335 Garden Inc., Files OPA-2018-W/03, SW-2018-06, and Z-23-18  Graham Wilson, Planner I, provided a PowerPoint presentation which  included an overview of the application.  David McKay representing Signature 4335 Garden Inc., provided an  overview of the application.  The Chair opened the floor for comments from the public.  Richard Klingler, 4835 Garden St. N., stated that he was concerned that  the land is currently zoned as agriculture and that he would prefer if the  development was comprised of 2-storey buildings. He noted that all the  lands to the east of the site are environmentally protected and that the  lands to the north are 10 acre lots that are environmentally protected.  He indicated that the area has sand deposits and that the development  will impact ground water for area residents on wells and septic systems.  He raised concerns related to snow plowing in the area, given that  streets in the area serve as school bus routes for children.   Chair Roy indicated that the staff report will be sent to the Central Lake  Ontario Conservation Authority for comment on environmental issues.   Robert Montoni, 4780 Garden Street, expressed concerns related to  Page 3 of 9  Public Meetings Minutes   January 28, 2019 - 7:00 PM    excessive pedestrian traffic in the area. He stated that the end of his  street is frequently a site for illegal dumping. He indicated that people  currently use the street as a jogging route and to walk their dogs and  that it would get busier with the new development. He stated that the  existing residents would lose their serenity as the area becomes busier.  He indicated that he was concerned about the impact the development  would have on wells and septic systems in the area.  There were no further submissions from the public.       5.  Planning and Development Department Report, PL 15-19  Re: Zoning By-law Amendment Application, 1154936 Ontario Limited,  665 Taunton Road East, File Z-21-18  Kathryn Kram, Planner II, provided a PowerPoint presentation which  included an overview of the application.  Bryce Jordan representing 1154936 Ontario Limited, provided an  overview of the application.   Olga Labaj, 7 Butterfly Court, stated that she had concerns related to  the proposed density of the development. Considering traffic congestion,  she stated that the area requires low density homes to compliment the  current single-detached homes in that area. She stated that due to traffic  on Taunton Road, the area has high number of vehicles performing u- turns, and with this development there would be an increase in the  number of vehicles in the area. She indicated that there is a heavy  pedestrian traffic in the area and a nearby school. She asked if there is  a possibility of installing a traffic light in the area to increase pedestrian  safety and reduce the number of vehicles performing u-turns.    Planning staff indicated that traffic impacts would be evaluated by the  Town's Public Works Department as part of the application.  There were no further submissions from the public.       6.

Page 4 of 9  Public Meetings Minutes   January 28, 2019 - 7:00 PM    Tina Lawton, 8 Thistledown Crescent, expressed concern regarding the  current zoning of the property which is agricultural and the high density  being proposed. She expressed concerns regarding the dynamic that  the development would bring to the subdivision, and access to Taunton  Road and increased traffic that would be generated once the building is  completed. She stated that the street she lives on has limited traffic, and  that the construction will result in safety issues in her neighbourhood.  She also stated that the proposal indicated a reduction of on-site parking  and this would further impact street parking in the area.   Terry Rudkins, 4 Thistledown Crescent, stated that he had the same  concerns as expressed by Ms. Lawton.  There were no further submissions from the public.       7.  Planning and Development Department Report, PL 16-19  Re: Zoning By-law Amendment Application, 1056626 Ontario Inc.,  Garden Street, File Z-29-18  Kathryn Kram, Planner II, provided a PowerPoint presentation which  included an overview of the application.  Bryce Jordan, representing 1056626 Ontario Inc., provided an overview  of the application.  The Chair opened the floor for comments from the public.  William Kemp, 1120 Green Street, stated that residents were not  informed of the upcoming development. He stated that he was  concerned regarding the density and the impact that it would have on  the whole community, not only to residents living within 120 meters of  the proposed development. He asked for more information as the  development moves forward. He stated that traffic will be a concern, and  that he is concerned that the Town does not have enough emergency  services to service all the new developments occurring. He expressed  concern regarding a nearby creek that would be impacted by the  development, and indicated that the creek was a salmon spawning  ground.  There were no further submissions from the public.       8.  Planning and Development Department Report, PL 11-19  Re: Official Plan Amendment Application OPA-2018-W/05, Zoning By- law Amendment Application Z-30-18, Site Plan Application SP-44-18,  7902484 Canada Inc c/o Triovest Realty Advisors, 304, 308, 368, 372,  374 and 378 Taunton Road East  Page 5 of 9  Public Meetings Minutes   January 28, 2019 - 7:00 PM    Deanna Schlosser, Planner II, provided a PowerPoint presentation  which included an overview of the application.  Eric Saulesleja representing 7902484 Canada Inc c/o Triovest Realty  Advisors, provided an overview of the application.  The Chair opened the floor for comments from the public.  Graham Bye, 915 Green Street, questioned how the Town's existing  transportation corridors would get traffic from new developments to  Highway 401. He expressed concern about the number of schools,  senior's residences, and hospitals in the Town, indicating that there may  not be enough of these resources in the Town to serve a rapidly growing  population.   Chair Roy advised that when applications are made by developers, they  are also submitted to other agencies for response such as Durham  Region Transit, the Region of Durham, and the Durham Regional Police  Service so that these agencies can provide comment.  There were no further submissions from the public.       9.

Page 6 of 9  Public Meetings Minutes   January 28, 2019 - 7:00 PM    The Chair opened the floor for comments from the public.    Graham Bye, 915 Green Street, noted the absence of Green Street in  the traffic study for the development. He stated he was concerned that  with residential development, that traffic in the area would increase  considerably. He raised concerns related to pollution, pedestrian safety,  loss of privacy, and decreased property values.  Shawn Lowes, 203 Clemence Street, stated the development would  impact his privacy. He stated that there was little community  engagement and the residents were provided with short notice about the  development. He questioned when construction would begin, and what  would be done to mitigate noise, dirt, and air pollution during  construction and after it was completed. He stated that the development  did not have sufficient parking spaces for the retail space and that this  would impact existing streets. He questioned how the development  would impact existing infrastructure including water, sewer, and waste  collection, and noted that the development would have a negative effect  on his solar panels and vegetable gardens due to shadowing.   Stewart Lawrence, 208 Clemence Avenue, stated that the proposed  development site was one of the busiest intersections in the Town, and  the proposed commercial space would add to traffic. He questioned if  the development had plans to provide for parking for the  residents,  visitors, as well as parking spaces for retail customers and delivery  vehicles. He stated that he felt the development was inappropriate and  the process lacked transparency.   Susan Honderich, 1109 Green Street, stated that during the municipal  election the issue of excessive traffic and excessive speed was raised.  She stated that the proposed construction will add to the existing  problems of traffic safety and would negatively impact her quiet  community.  Diane Huson, 1116 Green Street, stated that the development will  interfere with direct sunlight onto her property and would negatively  impact the solar panels on her roof. She questioned if a shade study  had been conducted. Ms. Huson stated parking may not be sufficient,  and that allowing the developer to pay cash in lieu for parking spaces  and reducing the total number of parking would create more safety and  traffic hazards on Green Street. She noted that noise from added traffic  and construction was a concern.  William Kemp, 1120 Green Street, expressed concern that the  construction will ruin the balance of the community. He noted there  would be increased traffic flow on already narrow streets, leading to  Page 7 of 9  Public Meetings Minutes   January 28, 2019 - 7:00 PM    difficult navigation in the proposed area. He noted that he would lose  privacy due to the height of the proposed building.   Shellie Taylor, 1126 Green Street, noted that the Town lacked resources  such as first responders, teachers, doctors, and hospitals to service all  the new development occurring in the community. She noted the area  was prone to flooding, and that this problem could get worse with  additional development.   Maree Donoghue, 110 Clemence Street, raised concerns with the  ground water in the proposed development area. She stated that the  development would block sunlight and impact privacy. She noted that  the architecture of the proposed building was not keeping with Whitby's  heritage image. Ms. Donoghue asked about the maintenance and  upkeep of the building and how the Town would ensure that the  developer would keep to its plan for the development.   Simon Bye, 915 Green Street, stated that the development was at a  busy intersection, and he was concerned about safety and the impact  that the development would have on the school bus routes in the area  due to traffic congestion and construction.  Bill Huson, 1116 Green Street, questioned if the Canada Post super- mailbox would be relocated. He noted safety concerns as sidewalks  near super mail-boxes in the area were not being cleared of snow.    Chair Roy advised that the location of super-mailboxes is determined by  Canada Post.   David Hiscox, 911 Athol Street, expressed concern related to traffic  congestion. He questioned whether Burns Street would be widened. He  noted that Athol Street from Clemence to Burns Street is unobstructed  as there are no stop signs for 4 blocks along the street. He expressed  safety concerns with people speeding through the area. He noted that  the traffic lights in the area create traffic issues each morning. He noted  that most parents drive their children to school in the mornings and that  there is no available on-street parking on Green Street. He questioned  where commercial vehicles servicing the development would park.   Pearl Bird, 1110 Green Street, raised concern about the removal of  trees from the property. She noted there would be an increase in carbon  emissions, increased flood risk, air pollution, light pollution, reduced  biodiversity, local water scarcity, increased risk of traffic accidents, and  noise pollution.  Janet Armstrong, 1115 Byron Street S., raised a concern about traffic  congestion. She noted that it is difficult to turn south on Brock Street to  get to Highway 401 due to traffic pulling into the GO station. She stated  Page 8 of 9  Public Meetings Minutes   January 28, 2019 - 7:00 PM    that on weekends, Arthur Street has cars parked along its length,  effectively reducing traffic to one lane. Ms. Armstrong noted that the  south side of Byron Street has traffic congestion due to ongoing water  pipe repairs and construction in the area. She noted concerns related to  noise due to ongoing construction and heavy equipment in the area.    Chair Roy asked the proponent to respond to the concerns brought  forward by members of the public.  The proponent, Mr. Brutto, indicated that a reduction in parking spaces  was possible because there was both residential and commercial  spaces in the development. He noted that these uses tend to require  parking at different times of the day.  The proponent indicated that there would be a construction  management plan in place to reduce noise, dust, and dirt.  The proponent stated that a shadow study had been completed,  showing that the impacts to neighbouring properties would be later in  the evening.   There were no further submissions from the public.   The meeting adjourned at 10:08 p.m.      Kevin Narraway, Manager of Legislative  Services/Deputy Town Clerk      Page 9 of 9

IN THE MEETING HALL OF THE WHITBY MUNICIPAL BUILDING PRESENT: Mayor Perkins Mayor Perkins in the Chair Councillor Coe Councillor Drumm Councillor Emm Councillor Hanson Councillor Mitchell Councillor Montague Councillor Roy STAFF PRESENT: R. Petrie, Chief Administrative Officer S. Beale, Commissioner of Public Works K.R. Nix, Commissioner of Corporate Services/Treasurer B. Short, Commissioner of Planning D. Wilcox, Town Clerk M. Pettit, Deputy Clerk 1. DISCLOSURES OF INTEREST There were no disclosures of interest noted. 2. ITEM FOR CONSIDERATION BY COUNCIL IN COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE (per Council Resolution No. 253-08) 2.1 Planning Report, Item PL 21-12 Re: Official Plan Review – Public Meeting – Draft Policy Discussion Papers – (OPA-2007-W/04) RESOLUTION NO. 68-12 MOVED by Councillor Mitchell Seconded by Councillor Montague That Council resolve itself into Committee of the Whole with Councillor Coe in the Chair to consider Planning Report, Item PL 21-12, Official Plan Review – Public Meeting – Draft Policy Discussion Papers – (OPA-2007- W/04). CARRIED Councillor Coe in the Chair. The Town Clerk advised members of the audience on the process of Public Meetings.  MINUTES OF THE SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY HELD ON MONDAY, MARCH 19, 2012 AT THE HOUR OF 6:00 P.M. IN THE MEETING HALL OF THE WHITBY MUNICIPAL BUILDING R. Short, Commissioner of Planning introduced the report and provided a synopsis of the process undertaken to date. Chair Coe declared the meeting to be a public meeting and invited submissions from the audience. Robert Nixon, 9190 Ashburn Road, appeared before Committee of the Whole, and provided a brief review of the milestones and decisions since the Official Plan Review had been undertaken. Mr. Nixon expressed objections over the urban boundary expansion in North Whitby, and stated that the Ministry has made no decision on the boundary expansion and should therefore not be included in the Official Plan Review being considered. Mr. Nixon also expressed concern regarding the failure of the Official Plan Review to fully incorporate the direction of the OPA 90 Intensification Plan that was approved by Town of Whitby Council in 2011 and that the continuing exploitation of farmlands and prime agricultural land to accommodate more residential lands would be detrimental to the overall health of the community. David Axhorn, 7421 Cochrane Street, appeared before Committee of the Whole, and enquired why Lakeridge Road or other routes could not be used for the purpose of a proposed parkway as this would be less disruptive to residents. Mr. Axhorn also enquired why a parkway would be required further north than Highway 407 and why there is a need for so much land for the road allowance. Mr. Axhorn advised in his opinion this parkway is not necessary. R. Petrie, Chief Administrative Officer advised that the map included in the Plan is conceptual in nature and that there is no plan to have a 400 foot road allowance to accommodate the proposed parkway. Mr. Petrie also advised that the Transportation Master Plan was completed a few years ago through a public process, however given the number of residents who were not aware of this, he recommends that further public consultation with the community be undertaken to review what the future transportation needs are in Brooklin, what alternative options are to be investigated and evaluated to determine the preferred solution. Mr. Petrie advised that the Public Works Department would schedule a public meeting in this regard for the fall of this year and that all those residents who signed in tonight or whose lands would be affected by the proposed parkway would be notified by mail of the meeting date and time. Ian Finch, 7621 Cochrane Street, appeared before Committee of the Whole, and enquired how long the environmental assessment would take and noted that property owners would be unable to sell while their residences were tied up waiting for the study to be completed, which would reduce the value of their homes. Mr. Finch enquired if the Town of  MINUTES OF THE SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY HELD ON MONDAY, MARCH 19, 2012 AT THE HOUR OF 6:00 P.M. IN THE MEETING HALL OF THE WHITBY MUNICIPAL BUILDING Whitby would be compensating owners for this inconvenience. Robin Mason, 7600 Cedarbrook Trail, appeared before Committee of the Whole, and enquired if the meeting in the fall was just postponing the matter and asked for clarification on whether this was considered the default position until such time as the review was completed. Mr. Mason advised he was supportive of getting truck traffic off Highway 12 but was not convinced this was the optimum solution to achieve this as it just relocates the problem to another area of town. R.. Petrie, Chief Administrative Officer advised that the meeting in the fall would cover not just the proposed parkway location but would include a review of all options for the area. Sharon Johnson, 340 Watson Street, #418, appeared before Committee of the Whole, and advised that transportation studies had been completed years ago and do not appear to be working as the current transportation system is insufficient for the volume of traffic. Ms. Johnson enquired if the study was predicting far enough in the future and if there were contingencies in the plan to deal with higher traffic volumes than anticipated. S. Beale, Commissioner of Public Works advised that the Transportation Master Plan was based on a 2031 horizon and the plan would be reviewed every five to ten years to determine if adjustments were required. Robert Walton, 7491 Cochrane Street, appeared before Committee of the Whole, and advised that the proposed parkway has been talked about for decades but nothing has ever happened. Mr. Walton expressed concerns that the proposed parkway location would have a detrimental affect on the property value of resident's homes and queried why he and other residents were not notified by personal mail of the meeting. Mr. Walton suggested that other options be reviewed. R. Petrie, Chief Administrative Officer, advised that the purpose of tonight's meeting was not to discuss the parkway, but to review the Official Plan Discussion papers. Mr. Petrie advised that the study is not yet underway for the proposed parkway but once it is underway all property owners affected would be notified through personal mail. Paul Duggan, 7365 Country Lane, appeared before Committee of the Whole, and advised that he concurs with the previous speakers and that he was also unaware of the proposed parkway. Mr. Duggan advised he is not opposed to progress but objects to having his property kept in a holding pattern until a definite location for the parkway is determined.  MINUTES OF THE SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY HELD ON MONDAY, MARCH 19, 2012 AT THE HOUR OF 6:00 P.M. IN THE MEETING HALL OF THE WHITBY MUNICIPAL BUILDING Phil Nicols, 17 Springsyde Street, appeared before Committee of the Whole, and advised that his parcel of land at the corner of Lakeridge Road/Highway 2, has been in his family's possession for fifty years and many proposals have been put forward throughout the years however none have ever come to fruition. Mr. Nicols questioned the Provincial plans to have an interchange at Lakeridge Road/Highway 401 and why this was not being pursued. B. Short, Commissioner of Planning, advised that the subject property is designated for employment purposes and this will be held in abeyance until ROPA 128 is settled. Mr. Short advised that Mr. Nicols could get further information by contacting Planning staff. Karen and Paul Pearson, 7460 Country Lane, appeared before Committee of the Whole, and advised he was unaware where the proposed parkway was going to be built and that this would jeopardize any chances of selling his home, should he wish to do so in the future. Mr. Pearson advised he was unaware the meeting was occurring tonight and enquired why an alternate route further to the north could not be found that would lessen the impact on existing property owners. R. Petrie, Chief Administrative Officer, advised that the meeting taking place in the fall would include a review to determine if the parkway was necessary and review alternatives to see if there was a better option. This process would include public participation throughout and should a better solution be determined it would be included into the Official Plan. Lydia Hartley, 7492 Ashburn Road, appeared before Committee of the Whole, and advised she firmly believes that this proposed parkway drawn on the plan will definitely affect property values and enquired if it could be removed from the drawings until the study and the review of all alternatives has been completed. R. Petrie, Chief Administrative Officer, advised that the line does not exist in the Town's existing Official Plan at this point in time and that the best thing we can do is proceed with the study to determine a location for the proposed parkway. Sophie Bigham, 7425 Country Lane, appeared before Committee of the Whole, and enquired why she was not notified of the proposed parkway intersecting her lands as indicated on the map. Ms. Bigham feels that she cannot continue to make any improvements or changes to her home or property until this matter is settled and enquired how long it would be before residents had a firm answer on the exact location of the proposed parkway. S. Beale, Commissioner of Public Works, advised that the study is anticipated to begin in the fall and would take approximately 12-14 months to complete, however the answers to whether the parkway was even needed and the location would be determined at 6-8 months from study commencement. The requirements for the study would be a very formal public process including a Terms of Reference and an environmental assessment with the Ministry of Environment giving final approval before proceeding. Ms. Beale advised that the development of a  MINUTES OF THE SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY HELD ON MONDAY, MARCH 19, 2012 AT THE HOUR OF 6:00 P.M. IN THE MEETING HALL OF THE WHITBY MUNICIPAL BUILDING Community Advisory Committee specifically dedicated to this subject is likely to be created in order to assist with the process. Carmen Duggan, 7365 Country Lane, appeared before Committee of the Whole, and advised that in her opinion the proposed parkway was not a solution but part of the problem of over development of the area particularly if the urban boundaries are expanded north of Columbus Road. Ms. Duggan advised she was not aware of any public process taking place during the consideration of the Transportation Master Plan and enquired if residents would have any say in the future placement of the parkway. R. Petrie, Chief Administrative Officer, advised that there is a very formal public process through the Ministry of Environment and that Council and Town staff will be very interested in hearing what residents' suggestions are for alternative locations of the parkway. Angelina Mason, 7600 Cedarbrook Trail, appeared before Committee of the Whole, and advised that when her family purchased their property they were of the understanding that this was a protected area that would not allow this kind of development and enquired if CLOCA had been involved in the decision. Ms. Mason enquired if the route shown would be the final one chosen unless another route was determined. S Beale, Commissioner of Public Works, advised that CLOCA was one of the reviewing agencies of the Transportation Master Plan as well as the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Transportation, who all reviewed and provided comment on the plan prior to it being approved at Council. Ms. Beale commented that the route planning of the corridor is part of the special study and that when the findings are completed there would need to be a review. Ms. Beale advised that as part of the class environmental assessment there is always the option to do nothing, or they could accept a portion of the proposed parkway route or use another alternative altogether. Marie Cockburn, 985 Brawley Road, Ashburn, appeared before Committee of the Whole, and advised she attended all the workshops last year and doesn't recall any mention of a proposed parkway in the Brooklin area. S. Beale, Commissioner of Public Works, advised that the Transportation Master Plan public meetings were a couple of years ago and separate and distinct from the Official Plan public workshops that were held last year. Robin Mason, 7600 Cedarbrook Trail, suggested that Council put forward a resolution removing the proposed parkway from the Transportation Master Plan and the Official Plan review in favour of a more general statement for getting heavy truck traffic off of Highway 12. R. Petrie, Chief Administrative Officer, advised that the proposed parkway would always be in the public realm as noted in the Transportation Master Plan subject to further study and staff would have to review and report back on the best  MINUTES OF THE SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY HELD ON MONDAY, MARCH 19, 2012 AT THE HOUR OF 6:00 P.M. IN THE MEETING HALL OF THE WHITBY MUNICIPAL BUILDING way to deal with the issues raised tonight. Barry Hum, 87 Tormina Boulevard, appeared before Committee of the Whole, and commented specifically in regard to the Official Plan, suggesting that benchmarks should be determined to review and measure how well we are doing in meeting the goals of the Official Plan, that partnerships be formed with the Boards of Education, business development communities, Durham College and UOIT and hospitals as examples in order to make the best use of community infrastructure. Mr. Hum also suggested the implementation of fibre optic communications throughout the Town to increase communication which could lessen the need for expanded transportation routes. Mayor Perkins advised that the Town of Whitby is the lower tier of the two tier structure and that not all functions are the sole responsibility of the Town. The Region is looking into fibre optics for Durham Region and the hospital falls under the jurisdiction and authority of the Province. B. Short, Commissioner of Planning, advised that benchmarks are set out under the Planning Act as well as some internally developed benchmarks and that the Town is moving forward in this direction. Matthew Cory, of Malone Given Parsons, appeared before Committee of the Whole, on behalf of the Brooklin North Land Owners group, and advised that he did appear at the public meetings when the Transportation Master Plan was being considered and that they encouraged the Town to take a longer term horizon of 50 years at that time and when looking at the arterial parkway that other alternatives be looked at by considering an option that made the most use of existing infrastructure. Mr. Cory advised that they believe that planning of the area done over the long term and determination of land uses should be undertaken simultaneously with the planning of the road system. Mr. Cory advised that a clear definition of environmental features and policies is required as the environmental assessment process is often delayed when these have not been determined. Mr. Cory advised that the group has not submitted their written comments as of this date but intend to do so very shortly. B. Short, Commissioner of Planning, advised that they have definitions in terms of looking at natural heritage features and that this technical exercise can be advanced as the Region has undertaken an environment first approach in other instances. Geoff Nova, 7505 Cedarbrook Trail, appeared before Committee of the Whole, and advised they had been told the study area is due to a need for more transportation and that the line as it is currently drawn dissects his property. Mr. Nova suggested that the study be completed first and then come back to residents who may or may not be affected but in the interim remove the line from the map. There were no further public submissions. Chair Coe closed the public  MINUTES OF THE SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY HELD ON MONDAY, MARCH 19, 2012 AT THE HOUR OF 6:00 P.M. IN THE MEETING HALL OF THE WHITBY MUNICIPAL BUILDING meeting.

Mr. Edwards advised that  Vaultra Storage was partnering with Fieldgate Developments to create  the composite employment development as outlined in the Staff report.  He noted the concerns raised by Economic Development Staff about the  initial construction phases only including self-storage facilities and the  possibility that further phases of the development may not be realized.  Mr. Shanmuganathan confirmed that the entire site would be developed  all at once and that it would not be developed in phases. Mr. Edwards  advised that they were available to answer questions.      2.4  Navdeep Nijhawan  Re: Planning and Development (Planning Services) Department Report,  PDP 28-22  Official Plan and Zoning By-law Amendment Applications, 412 Dundas  Developments Limited (Vaultra Storage), Block 270 on Plan 40M-2647,  West Side of Des Newman Boulevard, File Numbers: DEV-10-21 (OPA- 2021-W/04, Z-07-21)    Refer to Item 4.5, PDP 28-22  Navdeep Nijhawan, 27 Edgar Avenue, Richmond Hill, stated that he was  a physician and current partner of the proposed healthcare complex that  was under construction just north of the proposed development, and the  co-owner of the four-acre vacant land located just south of the proposed  development. Mr. Nijhawan advised that the entire area was designated  as Prestige Employment with residential and mixed-use lands  surrounding. He stated that he did not have any objection to the two  multi-use prestige industrial buildings, but that he was opposed to the  rezoning of the land to allow the construction of the four-storey and five  single-storey commercial self-storage facilities. Mr. Nijhawan noted that  when this land was purchased all of the surrounding neighbours  understood that they were purchasing Prestige Employment land which  Page 3 of 10  Committee of the Whole Minutes   May 02, 2022 - 7:00 PM    would have been known by the developers who purchased this land. He  commented on the approval of rezoning of this land being patently unfair  to homeowners and other prestige employment landowners in the area  who would have purchased their properties with a clear understanding  of how their community would be developed. Mr. Nijhawan stated that  having self-storage facilities, no matter how small, was a contravention  of Zoning By-law # 1784, and that previous Council decisions made it  clear that self-storage units were better placed in Industrial Zone areas  separate from Prestige Employment and residential communities. Mr.  Nijhawan noted that the Urban Design Guidelines approved by Council  on April 7, 2016 provided a specific vision for the area that did not  include self-storage units. He stated that self-storage units would not be  the highest or best use of these lands and that they would remove the  vibrancy of the area and effectively create a ""dead zone"" where people  would come in and out of the area to access their storage unit and  leave. He raised concerns about the storage facilities creating additional  traffic in the residential neighbourhood, noting that they would not  provide any ancillary employment opportunities or generate any  significant revenue for the community, and that there would be a  disproportionate benefit to non-residents of the community. Mr.  Nijhawan raised further concerns about self-storage units exposing the  area to significant risks including criminal behaviour, noting that in 2021  a self-storage facility in Whitby had over 40 break-ins, and that there  were already several dozen storage facilities located within Durham  Region. He noted that this developer has a storage facility located in  Ajax and that it was not located near a residential community or a  Prestige Employment community. Mr. Nijhawan inquired about the  number of storage unit facilities needed in Durham Region. He stated  that the Staff report notes concerns raised by the Region of Durham  about using the proposed site as a self-storage facility indicating that  self-storage facilities typically result in very low employment density  which does not support the Region's goal of achieving increased local  employment for residents and the higher employment densities  expected within designated Prestige Employment areas. Mr. Nijhawan  requested that the Committee reconsider supporting the application to  rezone the land to permit self-storage facilities on the site. He stated  that, while the Staff report recommends approval of the rezoning, there  was a certain intangible effect of having self-storage units in the area  that deters from ensuring that the community can achieve its highest  potential. Mr. Nijhawan advised that the decision that the Committee  makes now would significantly impact the nature of future developments  in the area. He stated that he hoped that the Committee would ensure  that the development of the West Whitby community satisfies the vision  of the original plan.   Page 4 of 10  Committee of the Whole Minutes   May 02, 2022 - 7:00 PM    It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 4.5, PDP 28-22, at  this time.    3.

He further  noted that the owner of the neighboring property (north) closest to the sprinter van, has  forwarded a letter of support to the Committee.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  J. Cardwell asked the applicant if he stores material associated with his commercial  business on the roof of the sprinter van.  R. Johnston replied no.  D. McCarroll asked the applicant if he ever affixes ladders to the side of the sprinter  van.  R. Johnston replied no.   Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  B. O'Carroll stated that she has no issues with the variance. She noted that because the  van is parked close to the house, and there is no sidewalk on the applicants side of the  street there would not be any sight line issues.  R. Johnston agreed.  The Chair asked if there were any further questions from the Committee. There were  none.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that a letter of support was received from the  neighbour at 103 Holiday Drive. A copy of this letter was circulated to the Committee  prior to the meeting.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.  Moved by: N. Chornobay  That the application to increase the maximum permitted height of a recreational vehicle  from 2.0m 2.7m inclusive of a roof top apparatus located at 105 Holliday Drive be  Granted.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variance is  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.  Having considered the contents of all written submissions, the staff report and oral  submissions had an effect on the Committee's decision.   Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/85/19  Kevin Washington  31 Montgomery Avenue  An application has been received from Kevin Washington, for variances from the  provisions of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  The application is for permission to:  1. increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 20% to 34%, and 2. reduce the minimum required front yard setback from 9.0m to 7.0m. The requested variances are required to permit the removal of an existing dwelling and  construction of a new two storey dwelling on the subject property.  The subject property is located at 31 Montgomery Avenue and is zoned Brooklin  Secondary Plan Residential (R3-BP) within the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law.  In Support of Application  Kevin Washington (Applicant)  In Opposition of Application  No one in attendance  Also in Attendance  Tom Johnston (Resident)  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  K. Washington introduced himself to the Committee as the applicant. He advised the  Committee that the existing dwelling will be demolished and a new two storey home will  be constructed. The new dwelling will occupy a 34% lot coverage and will be  approximately 2,500 sq.ft in size. He noted that the 20% maximum permitted lot  coverage is too restrictive.  Lastly, the applicant concluded that a variance to reduce the minimum required front  yard setback is proposed. The new dwelling will have a 7.0m front yard setback  whereas the Zoning By-law requires a 9.0m minimum setback. In his opinion this  variance is appropriate as the proposed dwelling will be in line with the neighboring  dwellings to the north and south.  The Chair asked the applicant if he was aware of the comments provided by the Public  Works Department, and if he has prepared a storm water management brief.  K. Washington replied that a storm water management brief has not yet been prepared.  B. O'Carroll asked if the proposed home office in the dwelling will be for personal use  or for a home based business.   Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  K. Washington replied that the home office will be for personal use.  J. Cardwell stated that this area has seen many minor variance applications.  D. McCarroll asked the applicant to confirm that they will be fully demolishing the  existing dwelling including the removal of the foundation.  K. Washington replied yes.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that no public correspondence was received.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.  T. Johnston introduced himself to the Committee as the owner of 29 Cassels Road  West. His property is situated directly north of the applicant's property. T. Johnston  expressed his concern that the privacy hedge that is situated between his property and  the applicant's property may be damaged when the new dwelling is constructed.  N. Chornobay noted that this feature is boundary tree/hedge if it is located on the  common property line.  The Chair noted that the proposed dwelling will be sited further away from the hedge  than the existing building today. Therefore, there should be no impact.  T. Johnston agreed and had no further comments.  Moved by: D. McCarroll  That the application to 1) increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 20% to  34%, and 2) reduce the minimum required front yard setback from 9.0m to 7.0m located  at 31 Montgomery Avenue be Granted subject to the following condition:  1. That the applicant provide a grading plan and stormwater management brief to the  Public Works Department for review and approval prior to the issuance of a building  permit.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variance is  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.   Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/86/19  Mattamy Homes  915 Rossland Road West  An application has been received from Mattamy Homes, for a variance from the  provisions of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  The application is for permission to reduce the minimum required rear yard setback  from 7.5m to 7.0m.  The requested variance will apply to 118 residential lots within the applicants proposed  subdivision, and is required to permit the development of single detached residential  dwellings on such lots.  The subject property is located at 915 Rossland Road W and is zoned Low Density (LD)  within the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  In Support of Application  Charlie Frise (Applicant)     Liana Dimaranan (Applicant)   In Opposition of Application  No one in attendance  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  C. Frise and L. Dimaranan introduced themselves to the Committee as the applicants.  C. Frise advised the Committee that they are requesting a variance to reduce the  minimum required rear yard setback from 7.50m to 7.0m which will allow them to  accommodate their pre-designed dwelling models on the subject lots. He expressed  that the variance will apply to three quarters of their dwelling models and the 7.0m rear  yard setback request also takes into account building tolerances.  L. Dimaranan noted that there were concerns identified by the Town of Whitby Public  Works Department at the time the Planning Staff Report was published. She noted that  at this time the Public Works Department has reviewed the variances in greater detail  and are in support of the application.  The Chair asked the applicants if they purchased the subject lots off of a developer.  L. Dimaranan replied yes.  The Chair expressed that when the lots were purchased the dimensions of the lots  would have been known to the applicant. He asked the applicant if they attempted to  reduce the depth of the dwelling to meet the required rear yard setback.   Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  C. Frise noted that the subdivision lotting has been finalized and increasing the depth of  the lots on the subdivision plan at this time is not feasible.  N. Chornobay advised the applicant that the Chair was referring to alterations to the  dwellings.  L. Dimaranan noted that this was not feasible since Mattamy Homes uses predesigned  dwelling models.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee members.  N. Chornobay noted that the Public Works Department initially did not support the  variances. He asked the applicant if they are now in support of the reduced 7.0m rear  yard setbacks.  L. Dimaranan replied yes.  N. Chornobay noted that Planning Staff were requesting that the variance be amended  from 7.0m to 7.25m.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that Planning Staff would support an amended  variance of 7.25m which reflected the rear yard setback as illustrated on the applicants  submitted plans.  L. Dimaranan noted that they would like to proceed with a minimum 7.0m rear yard  setback variance, as this is what they had previously discussed with the Development  Planning Department.   The Chair asked if the reduced rear yard setback would prevent future homeowner from  constructing rear yard decks.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that in the West Whitby Zoning By-law, decks greater  than 0.6m above grade would be permitted to encroach 3.5m into the rear yard, and  decks less than or equal to 0.6m above grade can encroach into the rear yard within  0.6m of the rear lot line.  D. McCarroll asked the applicant to confirm that they would like to proceed with the  minimum 7.0m required rear yard setback variance to accommodate their existing  dwelling designs.   L. Dimaranan replied yes.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that no public correspondence was received.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.   Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  J. Malfara advised the Committee that should they wish to approve the application they  may include a condition of approval limiting the variances to the lots as specifically  identified within the applicant's Minor Variance Application.  Moved by: N. Chornobay  That the application to reduce the minimum required rear yard setback from 7.5m to  7.0m located at 915 Rossland Road West be Granted subject to the following condition:  1. That the variances shall apply only to the 118 residential lots as identified within the  applicants Minor Variance Application.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variance is  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.   Item 3:  Approval of Previous Minutes  Moved by:  J. Cardwell  That the minutes of the Committee of Adjustment held on Thursday  November 07, 2019 be adopted.  Carried  Item 4:  Other Business  There were no items raised under other business  Item 5:  Adjournment  Moved by:  B. O'Carroll  That this meeting of the Committee of Adjustment be adjourned.

Page 2 of 18  Committee of the Whole Minutes   October 21, 2019 - 7:00 PM    It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 4.1, CAO 30-19, at  this time.    2.  Delegations    2.1  Sue Green  Re: Office of the Chief Administrative Officer Report, CAO 29-19  Proposed Location of a Bronze Statue of Sir William Stephenson at  Celebration Square - Revised     Refer to Item 4.2, CAO 29-19  Sue Green and Bryan Green, 1733 Dufferin Street, appeared before the  Committee and advised that she has been in contact with Lynn Phillip  Hodgson, the leading authority on Camp X and Sir William Stephenson,  regarding the placement of the Sir William Stephenson statue. It was  agreed that Intrepid Park would not be an appropriate location for a  statue of this magnitude due to the threat of vandalism, the lack of  exposure to a work of art of this value, and lack of parking. She further  advised that a head study or a bust of Sir William Stephenson could be  easily reproduced at minimal cost and placed in Intrepid Park. The bust  would include information concerning the whereabouts of the larger,  more comprehensive statue. Ms. Green advised that staff and other  stakeholders were in agreement with Ruth Abernethy and Lynn Phillip  Hodgson that the most appropriate location for the statue would be  Celebration Square at the Central Library due to it being one of the most  visited locations in Whitby. She stated that this location aligns with the  criteria set out in the proposal for the vision of Downtown Whitby. She  provided the measurements of the proposed statue which would be 8  feet, 3 inches long and 4.5 feet wide for a total of 37 square feet, noting  that the estimated square footage of Celebration Square is 12,000  square feet. She suggested that positioning the statue near the corner of  Dundas and Henry Streets would make it visible to vehicular traffic  passing by on either of the two streets. She advised that Ruth Abernethy  created the bronze statue of Len Cullen which prompted her to carry out  research on Sir William Stephenson and subsequently suggested the  creation of the bronze portrait of Sir William Stephenson and its location.  Ms. Green noted that the Town of Whitby could own the Sir William  Stephenson statue. Ms. Green advised that she, her husband and Lynn  Phillip Hodgson were willing to raise funds to cover the cost for the  commission as well as for two head studies with one head study to be  placed at Camp X and one head study at Sir William Stephenson Public  School. She stated that in order to raise funds for the commission the  people willing to donate funds need to know where the statue would be  located. She urged Council to move quickly to allow Ruth Abernethy to  Page 3 of 18  Committee of the Whole Minutes   October 21, 2019 - 7:00 PM    be engaged in this commission immediately.   A question and answer period ensued between Members of Council and  Mr. and Mrs. Green regarding:  • the collection of donations for the project by the Town and  whether the Town would be issuing tax receipts for this project;  • the cost of the statue and whether there would be any impact on  the tax base;  • the approach taken to raise funds to commission the project and  what the outcome of the project would be should the Town of  Whitby not approve the location;  • the possibility of fundraising for the cost of installing the statue so  as not to impact tax payers;   • the challenges associated with the use of Celebration Square by  other groups;  • whether the statue would become the property of the Town once  installed.   The consensus of the Committee was to hear Item 4.2, CAO 29-19, at  this time.      2.2  Stan Mcgookin  Re: Public Works Department Report, PW 4-19  Proposed Bike Route Parking Restrictions, Update Traffic By-law 1862- 85     Refer to Item 4.8, PW 4-19  Stan Mcgookin, 1 Tallships Drive, appeared before the Committee and  stated that his home faces Whitby Shores Greenway. He advised that  he has a large family and that they have frequent get-togethers which  may include ten or more cars being parked along Whitby Shores  Greenway. He raised concerns regarding the proposal to implement no  parking on Whitby Shores Greenway as it would create additional  parked vehicles on Tallships Drive which would create safety issues for  children playing on the street and exacerbate the current parking issues  on Tallships Drive. Mr. Mcgookin noted that the front entrances of the  new condominiums in the area face Whitby Shores Greenway, and that  residents from the condominiums park in front of their homes. He  commented that vehicles were also parked on Whitby Shores Greenway  in the area of Whitby Shores Public School. Mr. Mcgookin advised that  he received the notice of the meeting on this matter on Friday prior to  the meeting and raised concerns about the notification process and the  timeline between receipt of the notification for the meeting and the  meeting date.  Page 4 of 18  Committee of the Whole Minutes   October 21, 2019 - 7:00 PM    The consensus of the Committee was to hear Item 4.8, PW 4-19, at this  time.    3.  Correspondence    3.1  There was no correspondence.    4.

Committee of Adjustment-16 Aug 2018.pdf	Committee of Adjustment	2018-08-16	"Minutes of the 11th Meeting of the  Committee of Adjustment    Meeting Date:   Thursday August 16, 2018  Meeting Time:  7:00 p.m.  Meeting Location:  Whitby Municipal Building  575 Rossland Road East, Committee Room 1  Present:  N. Chornobay, Chair  S. Haslam   J. Cardwell  B. O'Carroll  D. McCarroll  J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer  Item 1:  Disclosure of Interest:  There was no disclosure of interest by the members of the Committee of  Adjustment  Carried   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/51/18  Glen Schnarr & Associates Inc. on behalf of Victoria Street Storage Corp.  Victoria Street East  An application has been received from Glen Schnarr & Associates Inc. on behalf of  Victoria Street Storage Corp. for variances from the provisions of the Town of Whitby  Zoning By-Law 1784.  The application is for permission to:  1. increase the maximum permitted building height from 12.0m to 16.2m;  2. reduce the minimum required parking space ratio from 1 space per 100 sq.m of  gross floor area to 0.6 spaces per 100 sq.m of gross floor area;  3. reduce the easterly interior side yard setback from 3.0m to 1.0m;  4. increase the maximum permitted two-way driveway width from 10.0 to 14.5m;  5. increase the maximum permitted two-way aisle width serving a loading area from  8.5m to 15.5m; and  6. reduce the minimum number of required loading spaces from 4 to 3 spaces.  The subject property is located at the north west corner of Victoria Street East and  Thickson Rd S, and is zoned Special Purpose Commercial – Retail Warehouse  Exception 1 (C2-S-RW-1) within Zoning By-law 1784.  In Support of Application  Evan Perlman (Agent)  In Opposition of Application  None at this time  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  E. Perlman introduced himself to the Committee as the Planner retained by the owners  of the subject property. He expressed that six variances are required to permit the  proposed self-storage development which had received Site Plan Approval.  E. Perlman provided an overview of the requested variances, explaining that many of  the variances are required due to the fact that the Zoning By-law does not have specific  provisions for self-storage facilities.  E. Perlman noted that he reviewed the Planning Staff Report and had no issues with it.  The Chair asked if there were any questions of the Committee.  B. O'Carroll expressed that she was originally concerned with the driveway entrance  configuration, but is now satisfied as the Region of Durham has approved its  configuration.   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that no correspondence was received.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.  Moved by: J. Cardwell  That the application to (1) increase the maximum permitted building height from 12.0m  to 16.2m; (2) reduce the minimum required parking space ratio from 1 space per 100  sq.m of gross floor area to 0.6 spaces per 100 sq.m of gross floor area; (3) reduce the  easterly interior side yard setback from 3.0m to 1.0m; (4) increase the maximum  permitted two-way driveway width from 10.0 to 14.5m; (5) increase the maximum  permitted two-way aisle width serving a loading area from 8.5m to 15.5m; and (6)  reduce the minimum number of required loading spaces from 4 to 3 spaces located at  Victoria Street East be Granted subject to the following conditions:  1. That all Public Works requirements related to Site Plan application SP-07-17 are  complied with; and  2. That the Owner obtains the required permit from CLOCA pursuant to Ontario  Regulation 42/06.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variances are  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/52/18  Michael Finigan  124 Clear Spring Road  An application has been received from Michael Finigan for variances from the  provisions of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-Law 1784.  The application is for permission to:  1. operate a home based business in a private garage, whereas a home based  business is only permitted to operate within a dwelling unit; and  2. increase the gross floor area occupied be the home based business from 50  sq.m to 58.0 sq.m.  The subject property is located at 124 Clear Spring Road and is zoned First Density  Residential (R1) within Zoning By-law 1784.  In Support of Application (in attendance)  Michael Finigan  Denise Branton  In Opposition of Application (in attendance)  Paul Michel  Michael Van Cooten  Brenda Blake  Stephen Blake  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  M. Finigan introduced himself to the Committee as the owner of the subject property as  well as the owner of the home based business located at the subject property. He noted  that the property was purchased in December 2017 and since purchasing the property,  he has carried out renovations to the dwelling which resulted in a large influx of traffic  coming to the property during this time.  M. Finigan provided an overview of the requested variances. He stated that variance no.  1 is required to allow his home based business to operate within the garage, and  variance no.2 is required to increase the maximum permitted floor area of the home  based business.  M. Finigan advised the Committee that in his opinion each of the 4 tests required to  approve a Minor Variance are met.  D. Branton introduced herself to the Committee as being in support of the requested  variances, and was assisting the applicant in the application process. She expressed   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  that she is a lawyer, but was not retained to provide legal representation by the  applicant.  D. Branton explained that the garage is attached to the house, and if the garage door  openings were removed and enclosed, the garage would then become part of the  dwelling unit.  M. Finigan advised the Committee that he read the opposition letters provided to him by  the Secretary Treasurer in advance of the meeting. He noted that some of the letters  referenced group training as advertised on his website. M. Finigan expressed that the  website was not updated to reflect his current activities and any group activities that  were referenced were conducted outside of the home based business and subject  property.  The Chair asked if there were any questions of the Committee.  D. McCarroll asked the applicant what his hours of operation are.  M. Finigan replied that he operates Monday to Friday between 6:30am and 8:00pm, and  operates by appointment only. He offers approximately 3-4 classes per day, and the  classes are generally 45 minutes in duration.  S. Haslam asked the applicant if he has any employees.  M. Finigan replied no, but he does employ contract employees for off-site excursions.  J. Cardwell asked the applicant if he is the sole employee at the home based business.  M. Finigan replied yes.  B. O'Carroll asked the applicant if he plans to expand his business.  M. Finigan replied that he has been in the fitness industry for 18 years and the goal of  operating a home based business is to support a balanced lifestyle. He has no interest  in working late evenings or weekends, and is not interested in expanding his business.  S. Haslam asked the applicant if his 6:30am class is popular among his clients.  M. Finigan replied yes, and he offers 4 classes per week at 6:30am.  S. Haslam asked the applicant if he can shift his 6:30am class to begin at 7:00am,  which would allow him to limit any noise impacts.  M. Finigan replied yes, however, at 6:30am his classes are quite and do not cause any  noise impacts.  D. Branton replied that Clear Spring Road is a public street and the Noise By-law does  not regulate noise produced by vehicles traveling along the roadway.  S. Haslam replied that his concern pertains to impacts created by music.   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  M. Finigan replied that when music is playing, it can not be heard outside of the  building.  The Chair asked the applicant if the property was serviced by a septic system.  M. Finigan replied yes.  The Chair asked the applicant if he consulted with the Durham Region Health  Department regarding any additional servicing loads on the septic system.  M. Finigan replied that he consulted with the Durham Region Health Department and a  clearance was granted.  D. Branton noted that there is no change room or washroom facilities on the premises.  B. O'Carroll asked the applicant if the parking requirements of the Zoning By-law are  maintained.  M. Finigan replied yes.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara replied yes. A number of support and opposition letters were received from  members or the public and clients of M. Finigan. All correspondence was forwarded to  the Committee prior to the meeting.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.  P. Michel introduced himself to the Committee as the owner of the vacant lot south east  of the applicant's property. He advised the Committee of his objection to the requested  variances and recommended that the application be tabled.  P. Michel noted that the proposed variances and the requested use should not be  addressed by the Committee of Adjustment, but rather through a Zoning By-law  Amendment application.  The Chair asked if there was anyone else from the public who wished to speak to the  subject application.  M. Van Cooten introduced himself to the Committee as the owner of 105 Clear Spring  Road. He does not support the proposed variances and is concerned with the potential  future growth of the applicants business.  M. Van Cooten has no objection with the applicant operating legally within his  property/dwelling, but this is not the case as operating a home based business within a  garage is specifically not permitted.   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  M. Van Cooten expressed concerns with traffic. He advised the Committee that if  approved, the applicants home based business will generate approximately 49  additional cars traveling along Clear Spring Road per week. If the variance is granted,  and an accident occurs due to the increased traffic, will the Town of Whitby assume  liability?  The Chair asked if there was anyone else from the public who wished to speak to the  subject application.  B. Blake introduced herself to the Committee as the owner of 109 Clear Spring Road.  She appreciated the landscaping that was done by the applicant on the property, but,  she is not supportive of the variances.  B. Blake advised the Committee that one of her main concerns is traffic. She stated that  the subdivision lacks sidewalks, and residents are required to walk on the street. She  also noted that additional traffic has already made it more difficult to turn onto Brock  Street from Clear Spring Road.  The Chair advised B. Blake that a home based business is a permitted use on the  subject property.  The Chair asked if there was anyone else from the public who wished to speak to the  subject application.  S. Blake introduced himself to the Committee as the owner of 109 Clear Spring Road.  He noted that he has no qualms with the applicant on a personal level, but does not  support the variances as it compromises the public well being. He recommended that  the Committee deny the variances.  S. Blake expressed that he can not support the variances, ultimately due to the traffic  concerns. He advised that other similar sized gyms can generate hundreds of users per  day and if the applicant chooses to follow suite, there will be more cars traveling along  the street and a greater potential for an accident.  M. Finigan replied and agreed that there are no personal issues between himself and S.  Blake. He expressed that his intention is not to become a large commercial gym as  referenced by S. Blake. His primary activity includes 1 on 1 private sessions.  D. Branton stated that based on the comments provided by members of the public,  traffic is a concern. She noted that there are no provisions in the Zoning By-law to  prohibit the home based business use on the property. If a wall is constructed in front of  the garage doors, and the garage is converted to be part of the dwelling unit the  applicants business would be permitted.  M. Van Cooten asked the applicant why they intend to enlarge the garage if his primary  activity pertains to 1 on 1 private sessions.  M. Finigan replied that the garage is not being renovated or enlarged.   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Moved by: B. O'Carroll  That the application to (1) operate a home based business in a private garage, whereas  a home based business is only permitted to operate within a dwelling unit; and (2)  increase the gross floor area occupied be the home based business from 50 sq.m to  58.0 sq.m located at 124 Clear Spring Road be Granted subject to the following  conditions:  1.

That a maximum of 3 persons shall receive instruction/fitness training per class;  3. That the business shall operate only between the hours of 7am and 6pm;  4. That the business shall operate between Monday to Friday  The motion to approve the application subject to the conditions was not carried.  Moved by: D. McCarroll  That the application to (1) operate a home based business in a private garage, whereas  a home based business is only permitted to operate within a dwelling unit; and (2)  increase the gross floor area occupied be the home based business from 50 sq.m to  58.0 sq.m located at 124 Clear Spring Road be Denied.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the general intent  and purpose of the By-law is not maintained, and that the granting of the  application would result in an undesirable impact on the community.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the oral submissions and written  submissions had an effect on the Committee's decision.   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/53/18  Macaulay Shiomi Howson Ltd. on behalf of Urban Intensification Fund  1602 Tricont Avenue  An application has been received from Macaulay Shiomi Howson Ltd. on behalf of  Urban Intensification Fund for variances from the provisions of the Town of Whitby  Zoning By-Law 1784.

Jones also noted that variance No.2 is required for functionality and the safe  movement of tractor trailers within the site.  The Chair asked the applicant what the use of the proposed buildings will be?   L. Jones replied that at this time the buildings will be constructed as ""spec-built""  buildings.   The Chair asked if there were any questions of the Committee. There were none.   The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  J. Malfara replied that no correspondence was received.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.  Moved by: D. McCarroll  That the application to reduce the minimum landscaped area located within the front  yard and/or side yards from 10% to 8.7%; and to increase the maximum permitted width  of a two way aisle serving a loading area from 8.5m to 19.9m located at 1602 Tricont  Avenue be Granted subject to the following condition:  1.

Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.

Molloy for a variance from the provisions of  the Town of Whitby Zoning By-Law 1784.  The application is for permission to reduce the minimum required interior side yard  setback to a covered deck within the rear yard from 1.2m to 0.6m.  The subject property is located at 14 Albert Street and is zoned Brooklin Secondary  Plan Residential 3 (R3-BP) in the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  In Support of Application  P.J. Molloy  In Opposition of Application  None at this time  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  P.J. Molloy introduced himself to the Committee as the owner of the subject property.

Carried on a two thirds vote    3.6  Winny Li and Kevin Beaulieu representing Canadian Doctors for  Medicare  Re: Resolution in Support of Developing and Implementing a National  Pharmacare Program as an extension of Canadian Medicare.  Winny Li and Kevin Beaulieu representing Canadian Doctors for  Page 3 of 17  Regular Council Minutes   November 02, 2015 - 7:00 PM    Medicare appeared before Council and provided a PowerPoint  presentation with respect to developing and implementing a National  Pharmacare Program as an extension of Canadian Medicare.  Brief discussion ensued with respect to the importance of this initiative  and the benefits of such a program to citizens and the community.  Further discussion ensued regarding the importance of referring these  matters to the Provinces who deal with healthcare matters and relying  on their expertise to fully investigate this type of program.    Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Coe  Seconded By Councillor Roy    Whereas Whitby has recognized and has demonstrated over the past  years, its commitment to the importance of healthy citizens as the  foundation of a healthy, engaged and economically vibrant community;  and,     Whereas over 3 million Canadians, including many in our local  communities, don't take medicines prescribed by their doctors because  they can't afford them; and,     Whereas Canada is currently the ONLY country with a universal public  healthcare program that does not have a national pharmacare program;  and,     Whereas the risk of having no insurance for medicines is high among  lower income Canadians which includes the service industry, precarious  working and seasonal workers, like many in Whitby; and,     Whereas studies show that adding a national pharmacare program to  our national health care system would lower costs to businesses by over  $8 billion per years, providing Canadian companies competitive  advantages in international trade; and,     Whereas recent research confirms that these gains can be achieved  with little or no increase in public investment; and,    Whereas municipal government expenses for employee benefits would  be significantly reduced by a national pharmacare program; and,     Whereas a national prescription drug formulary would support better  Page 4 of 17  Regular Council Minutes   November 02, 2015 - 7:00 PM    quality prescribing, including reducing dangerous and inappropriate  prescribing to Canadian seniors; and,    Whereas a National Pharmacare plan is sound policy, both economically  and socially; and,    Whereas the Government of Canada has a responsibility under the  Canada Health Act to protect, promote and restore physical and mental  well-being of persons and enable reasonable access to health care  services without causing barriers, including financial barriers; and,    Whereas a national, universal Pharmacare program would enable all  Canadians access to quality, safe and cost effective medications,  improve health outcomes and generate cost savings;    Therefore be it resolved that Whitby express its support for the creation  of a National Pharmacare program as an extension of Canadian  Medicare, whereas health and economic studies now show that such as  policy would improve health in municipalities, give local businesses a  competitive advantage in the global marketplace and lower costs for  municipal government on taxpayers;     Be it resolved that Whitby calls on the Province of Ontario to work with  other Provinces and the Federal Government to develop and implement  a National Pharmacare program; and    Be it resolved that Whitby also urge the Federation of Canadian  Municipalities to adopt a similar resolution respecting the Federal  government; and,    Be it further that Whitby convey the decision of Council on this resolution  to the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, the Federation of  Canadian Municipalities, the Federal Minister of Health, and the Prime  Minister.    Note: The disposition of this matter, Item 3.6, was determined  through the referral motion below.    Resolution # 473-15    Moved By Councillor Emm  Seconded By Councillor Leahy    That the proposed motion in Support of Developing and Implementing a  Page 5 of 17  Regular Council Minutes   November 02, 2015 - 7:00 PM    National Pharmacare Program be referred to staff and brought forward  for consideration at the next regularly scheduled Council meeting to be  held on November 23, 2015.

She stated that OSRTF had drafted a model site alteration by-law which  was based on best practices of several municipal large site alterations  by-laws, included over 5 years of research on fill issues and had been  peer reviewed by specialists in the industry. She requested Whitby  Council to review the documents that she had submitted prior to the  Council meeting and consider the proposed recommendations during  the 90 day review period of the new site alteration by-law. She further  suggested that farmland not be exempted from obtaining fill permits due  to the potential amount of fill that could come in to large parcels of  farmland and the number of trucks required to haul in the fill.  She  further suggested that a separate security fee and a scaled application  fee be considered in the new by-law.

Committee of Adjustment-08 Jul 2021.pdf	Committee of Adjustment	2021-07-08	"Minutes of the 9th Meeting  Committee of Adjustment    Meeting Date:   Thursday July 8, 2021  Meeting Time:  7:00 p.m.  Meeting Location:  Virtual Meeting   Present:  N. Chornobay, Chair  S. Haslam   J. Cardwell  B. O'Carroll  D. McCarroll  J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer  J. Taylor, Senior Manager, Zoning & Regulation   Item 1:  Disclosure of Interest:  There was no disclosure of interest by the members of the Committee of  Adjustment  Carried       Minutes of the 9th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/64/21  Steve DeNoble on behalf of Tammy Shannon  56 Meadow Crescent (Severed Lands)  An application has been received from Steve DeNoble on behalf of Tammy Shannon,  for variances from the provisions of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  The application is for permission to (1) reduce the minimum required lot frontage from  21.5m to 19.0m; (2) increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 20% to 35%; (3)  reduce the minimum required front yard setback from 10.5m to 7.5m; (4) increase the  maximum permitted building height from 8.5m to 9.5m; and (5) reduce the minimum  required lot area from 925 sq. m to 725 sq. m.  The requested variances are required to permit the severance of the subject property  into two parcels, and to also permit the construction of a two storey detached dwelling  on the subject property.  In Support of Application  Dustin DeNoble   Steve DeNoble  Carmen Calabrese  In Opposition of Application  Barry French  Sheila Raitt  Kevin Kelly  Martha Kelly  Karen Pratt  Brian Pratt  Carol Cooper  Suzanne Cooper  Doug Wright  Heather Wright  Robert Ward  Michael Sigsworth  Sharron Field  Michael Mohammed  Dieter Germann  Les Brindley  Richard Matthews  Kimberly Van Winden  Chuck Van Winden  Bernard Lewis  Lesley Lewis  Amy Dickinson  Susan Dickinson  Joanne Stycuk  Arthur Armstrong   Minutes of the 9th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  S. DeNoble introduced himself to the Committee as one of the owners of the subject  property. He provide a brief overview of the requested variances and a summary of the  proposed work schedule.  S. DeNoble also expressed to the Committee that his intent is to construct a dwelling for  his son and that his partner's intent is to construct a home for his daughter on the  severed and retained lands, and that the proposed dwellings will not be offered for sale  to the public.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  J. Cardwell asked the applicant if there were any plans that could be shared.  S. DeNoble replied yes. He provided two comparables that were recently constructed in  Whitby. He concluded that homes similar to what is illustrated could be constructed on  the severed and retained lots.  J. Malfara shared the plans on the screen for the Committee and members of the public  to view, and noted that the plans were circulated to known interested parties in advance  of the meeting.  The Chair asked if there were any additional questions from the Committee.  S. Haslam noted that the Town is recommending that the proposed covered front porch  be limited to one storey in height and that the main portion of the dwelling maintain a  minimum 9.0m front yard setback. He asked the applicant if this is acceptable.  S. DeNoble replied yes.  The Chair asked if there were any additional questions from the Committee.  D. McCarroll asked the applicant if he is set on the style of buildings, as illustrated by  the comparables that were shared with the Committee and public.  S. DeNoble replied yes. He referred to this type of building typology as a bungaloft.  S. DeNoble expressed that he has no objection to the Town's Urban Design  Department reviewing the proposed building designs prior to any construction activities  taking place.  The Chair asked Planning Staff to provide a brief overview of the term architectural  control for members of the public.  J. Malfara stated that the Town of Whitby has an urban design team within the Planning  Department. They are able to provide detailed comments and recommendations to  proposed building elevations, massing, and overall designs to ensure that the proposal  represents a high standard of architectural design.   Minutes of the 9th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  J. Malfara advised that if the Committee sees fit, they can include a condition of  approval that would require approval from the Town's Urban Design Division with  regards to the dwelling designs.  The Chair asked if there were any additional questions from the Committee. There were  none.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that numerous emails were received from the  community, and these comments were provided to the Committee for their review prior  to the meeting.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.  D. Wright introduced himself to the Committee. He was also joined by his wife H.  Wright. They are the owners of the property at 60 Meadow Cres.  D. Wright stated that the requested variances are not minor in nature. He noted that the  variances would result in an excessively large dwelling on each of the proposed lots. D.  Wright stated that the proposal would result in dwellings that are not in keeping with the  neighbourhood character, would result in the loss of five mature trees, and would set a  precedent for future development in the neighbourhood.  D. Wright further stated that the massing of the proposed dwellings would result in  visual and shadowing impacts on his property. It was his understanding that only one  storey dwellings were permitted in the neighbourhood, and the proposed two storey  dwellings would not blend with the surrounding land uses.  The Chair asked if there were any questions or comments from the Committee or  applicant.  S. DeNoble stated that Mr. Wright's property has the same lot frontage as what is  proposed on the severed and retained lots.  The Chair asked if there was anyone else from the public who wished to speak to the  subject application.  K. Kelly introduced himself to the Committee and stated that the proposal would not  result in any added value to the neighbourhood. The proposal would result in visual  impacts from the dwellings and loss of vegetation. K. Kelly noted that his main concerns  relate to the increase in lot coverage, not necessarily the lot frontage reduction.  K. Kelly stated that the increase in lot coverage is not minor in nature, and the proposal  of two storey dwellings would not be in keeping with the surrounding area, which is  primarily characterized by one storey dwellings.   Minutes of the 9th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.  C. Calabrese introduced himself to the Committee as one of the applicants. He  concluded that the lot coverage increase would result in a dwelling that is approximately  2,200.0 sq. ft in size which is not out of character.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.  K. Pratt introduced herself and husband (B. Pratt) as the owners of 73 Meadow Cres.  She advised the Committee that the requested variances are not minor in nature. She  noted that the proposal would result in safety issues due to the road configuration, lack  of sidewalks, traffic, and the potential for increased on-street parking.  B. O'Carroll noted that the proposed garages would be setback further from the street,  in comparison to the main dwelling, thereby increasing the amount of usable driveway  space.  S. DeNoble stated that a minimum of four parking spaces could be accommodated on  the driveway and an additional two spaces in the garage for at total of six parking  spaces.  B. Pratt stated that they are new to the neighborhood, and he has noticed that this  street is frequently used by local residents for walking, and increased traffic may result  in safety issues.  K. Pratt asked if this application is approved, would it be precedent setting for future  redevelopment applications?  The Chair stated that anyone can apply for a Minor Variance application and the  Committee is here to speak to this specific application only and judge it on its own merit.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.  M. Sigsworth introduced himself to the Committee as the owner of 63 Meadow Cres. He  advised the Committee that this is a quiet neighborhood and if approved, this  application will be precedent setting for future proposals in the direct area. M. Sigsworth  noted that there is ample land in other areas in Whitby, and that these neighborhoods  should be preserved.  M. Sigsworth referenced the Town of Whitby Official Plan. He noted several excerpts of  the Official Plan and concluded that the proposal is not in keeping with these sections.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.   Minutes of the 9th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  B. Lewis introduced himself to the Committee as the owner of 77 Meadow Cres. It was  his understanding that only one storey dwellings were permitted on this street. He is  also concerned with the massing and size of the proposed dwellings, and that the  dwellings will be sold to the general market and not actually to the family members of  the applicant.  S. Haslam asked if there are any By-law provisions in place to restrict the height of the  dwellings to one storey.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that the maximum permitted building height for the  subject lands is 8.5m. The By-law does not limit the number of storeys, as long as the  building height does not exceed 8.5m.  The Chair asked what the approximate height of a 2 storey building is.  J. Malfara replied that an 8.5m tall building can permit two storeys. Staff have observed  slightly taller building heights required for modern dwellings where slightly greater floor  to ceiling heights are desired.  S. DeNoble emphasised that the existing lots located at 60 and 62 Meadow Cres are  the same size as what he is proposing.  A. Dickinson introduced herself to the Committee. She asked the applicant why he  chose this neighborhood to construct the two proposed dwellings. She also noted that  she shares the same concerns as the other residents who spoke prior to her.  S. DeNoble replied that the opportunity presented itself and this is an area that his son  would like to live in.  S. Raitt introduced herself as the owner of 59 Meadow Cres. She advised the  Committee that she also grew up in this neighborhood, and has come to recognize that  for each lot that is severed and redeveloped results in an increase in traffic and  vehicles. S. Raitt also noted that this proposal would result in a loss of greenspace and  mature vegetation and that the guiding principals in the Town of Whitby Official Plan are  not being met.  S. Raitt asked the Committee if the Committee has visited the neighborhood and if the  applicant's family are bound to live in the proposed dwellings.  The Chair stated that each of the Committee members have visited the area on multiple  occasions.  The Chair also noted that the Town can not restrict who lives in the dwellings and/or  how long they have to live in a dwelling.  S. DeNoble advised the Committee that he constructed his own home in Whitby 28  years ago, and continues to reside at this residence.   Minutes of the 9th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  D. Wright noted that the he has no objection to the size of the proposed lots, rather they  are primarily concerned with the proposed lot coverage, impacts of existing vegetation,  and massing of the proposed dwellings.  S. DeNoble advised the Committee that they will try to preserve as much vegetation as  possible. He noted that some trees will be impacted, but it is too early to confirm which  trees specifically will be impacted.  B. O'Carroll noted that private trees can be removed by home owners.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that the Town does not have a private tree cutting by- law. With certain exceptions, trees located on private properties can be removed by  home owners.  M. Sigsworth asked the Committee what steps have been taken to ensure that  neighborhoods like Meadow Crescent are preserved.  J. Taylor advised the Committee that initiatives such as Architectural Control have  proven successful in preserving neighborhood character when new development is  proposed. J. Taylor also expressed that variances for increased lot coverage have also  been applied for, and approved by the Committee within proximity to the subject  property. J. Taylor also noted that anyone on Meadow Crescent can construct a two  storey dwelling without any additional approvals, as long as the proposed dwelling is  within the 8.5m height restriction.  M. Sigsworth asked who he can speak with about expressing his views regarding how  future development is addressed in mature neighborhoods.  J. Taylor advised M. Sigsworth that he can speak with his local Councillor as well as  provide input to the Town's Zoning By-law review process and mature neighborhood  study.  K. Kelly noted that he can not dispute what the By-law currently permits. However, in his  opinion the requested variances do not meet the four Planning Act tests.  K. Kelly asked the Committee what would prevent the variances from being approved.  J. Malfara noted that the Planning Act sets out the four tests required to make a  decision on a Minor Variance application. J. Malfara read out the four tests.  J. Taylor also noted that the Committee can approve, deny, or table the application.  J. Taylor also provided a brief overview of appeal rights to the Ontario Land Tribunal  (OLT).  The Chair asked if the Committee was ready to make a motion on this item.  J. Cardwell asked J. Malfara to provide an overview of the conditions of approval, any  additional conditions that may be suitable, and the lot area variance amendment to the  application.   Minutes of the 9th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  J. Malfara and J. Taylor advised the Committee that an additional variance was  required. This variance would be noted as Variance #5 and is required to reduce the  minimum required lot area from 925 sq. m to 725 sq. m.  S. Haslam stated that he was willing to make a motion to approve variances 1, 3, 4, and  5, and table variance 2 to a future Committee of Adjustment meeting.  In addition the two conditions outlined in the staff report, S. Haslam's motion also  included the following additional conditions.  1. the building elevations are to be in keeping with the photographs and elevations  submitted by the applicants;  2. the building design be subject to Town of Whitby in-house architectural control  approval; and  3. the applicant receive final and binding approval from the Durham Region Land  Division Committee  The Chair asked J. Malfara to confirm that the architectural control would be conducted  by the Town of Whitby Planning Department.  J. Malfara replied yes.  Moved by: S. Haslam  The application to (1) reduce the minimum required lot frontage from 21.5m to 19.0m;  (3) reduce the minimum required front yard setback from 10.5m to 7.5m; (4) increase  the maximum permitted building height from 8.5m to 9.0m; and (5) reduce the minimum  required lot area from 925 sq. m to 725 sq. m located at 56 Meadow Crescent be  Granted, and variance (2) to increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 20% to  35% be Tabled to a future meeting pending the Committees review of an acceptable  siting plan, subject to the following conditions:  1.

Malfara and J. Taylor advised the Committee that it is their understanding that the  motion is to approve Parts 1, 3, 4, and 5 of the variance request subject to conditions  and subject to receipt of further information regarding Part 2 of the variance request  (being a variance to the coverage restrictions).  As a result, only Part 2 of the variance   Minutes of the 9th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  was tabled and will be added to the agenda of a future Committee meeting upon receipt  of additional information from the applicant regarding the variance request for  coverage.  A Notice of Decision will be issued upon full consideration and a decision  being made by the Committee on Part 2 of the overall variance request.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the approved  variances are minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the  By-law and the Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the  granting of the application is desirable and would result in the appropriate  development of the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.

Malfara to provide clarity on the condition pertaining to the front  yard setback.  J. Malfara provided an overview of the proposed conditions as outlined in the Planning  Staff Report.  The Chair asked if there were any questions or comments from the members of the  public.  J. Malfara noted that correspondence received from the previously application A/64/21  was also applicable to this application.  D. Wright expressed that in his opinion that requested variances are not desirable and  appropriate for the development of the subject lands and neighborhood.  D.

She  advised the Committee that a variance was previously approved to permit the  construction of a detached garage on the subject property.  L. Butler noted that a covered porch was constructed and attached to the garage. The  porch was constructed 4 years ago, but it was recently determined that a permit was  needed for this type of work. It was also determined that the porch would require  variances from the By-law.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  S. Haslam asked if the porch was for personal use.  L. Butler replied yes.  B. O'Carroll expressed that in the notice the structure is described as a lean-to  structure, whereas the staff report identifies the structure as a porch. For future  applications, B. O'Carroll asked that the terminology be consistent.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that no public correspondence was received.

Minutes of the 9th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/68/21  James Pitre on behalf of Taryn Ito  90 Meadow Crescent  An application has been received from James Pitre on behalf of Taryn Ito, for a variance  from the provisions of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  The application is for permission to increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from  20% to 26%.  The requested variance is required to permit the construction of an accessory structure  (pool cabana) within the rear yard of the subject property.   In Support of Application  James Pitre  In Opposition of Application  None at this time  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  J. Pitre introduced himself to the Committee. He advised the Committee that the  requested variance is required to permit a pool cabana structure located at the rear of  the property. The proposed structure would exceed the maximum lot coverage by 6%.  In his opinion, the requested variance meets the 4 tests as outlined by the Planning Act.  The Chair asked if there were any comments from the Committee.  B. O'Carroll asked the applicant if the were aware of the conditions proposed by the  Town of Whitby Public Works Department.  J. Pitre replied yes.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that a letter was received from Katherine Rocchio on  behalf of Maddalena and Pasquale Rocchio, the owners of 8 Eaton Court.

It is the assumption of the by-law that any  development within the Town will increase demand on municipal  services;   • The Development Charges Act does not permit Council to waive  or refund any portion of the development charges if the amount of  Page 2 of 4  Special Council Minutes   November 12, 2019 - 6:00 PM    the development charges is determined to be correct, and the  charges are correctly applied.

Narraway, Manager of Legislative Services/Deputy Clerk, provided an  overview of the format of the public meetings. He advised that members of the  public who wish to be notified of the next report related to any of the public  meetings or who wish to be placed on an Interested Parties List for a matter  should email the Town's Planning and Development Department at  planning@whitby.ca or call 905.430.4306 to leave a message.      1.  Planning and Development Department Report, PL 46-20  Re: Official Plan and Zoning By-law Amendment Applications, Northeast  Corner of Garrard Road and Conlin Road, Garrard Limited Partnership,  File Numbers: DEV-22-20 (OPA-2020-W/04 and Z-13-20)  R. Saunders, Commissioner of Planning and Development, provided a  PowerPoint presentation which included an overview of the applications.  Page 1 of 3  Public Meetings Minutes   November 09, 2020 - 7:00 PM    Mr. Andrew Sgro, Broccolini; Mr. Rodger Miller, Miller Planning  Services, and Mr. Alper Caglar, Architect, provided a PowerPoint  presentation which included a detailed overview of the applications.  The Chair indicated that comments would now be received from  members of the public who registered to speak.   Dan MacPherson, 999 Conlin Road, provided a PowerPoint  presentation which included photographs of his property, and details  pertaining to the zoning, size, and location of his property in relation to  the proposed development and the existing self storage units. Mr.  MacPherson stated that he has been a resident of Whitby for over 45  years and that he was opposed to the proposed development. He  advised that he and his wife purchased their property on Conlin Road  approximately five years ago as a retirement home. He advised that at  the time they purchased their property Tribute Homes was in the  process of rezoning the land west of his property, noting that they had  anticipated residential homes being constructed near their property in  the future. He stated that he and his wife chose this property because it  was located within Whitby, it was surrounded by agricultural land, they  liked the idea of country living in the city, and that it was what they were  looking for in a home to retire. He advised that his property was zoned  residential/agricultural, and that he and his wife had no idea that this  type of project would be proposed directly across from their property.  Mr. MacPherson stated that the view from his front window would be a  parking lot full of trucks, noting that this was not the view he had  envisioned in the future. He raised concerns about the negative impact  the proposed development would have on the volume and quality of his  well water, and on the value of his property. He noted that the addition  of 50 plus acres of cement and asphalt would have an impact on the  amount of available ground water for his well because the water would  drain into storm sewers. Mr. MacPherson raised further concerns about  the size and height of the proposed development, and the number of  parking spaces for employees and tractor trailer parking spaces located  directly opposite his home. He raised additional concerns regarding  heavy equipment traffic during construction which would result in  difficulty entering and exiting his property as well as impacts from  construction noise, dust, and debris. Mr. MacPherson stated that there  would be two warehouse complexes with a potential for thousands of  employees, vehicles, and trucks that would be travelling in and out of  the site resulting in constant excessive traffic, traffic issues, and safety  concerns on Conlin Road. He requested that appropriate sound barriers,  such as a berm, be erected on the north side of Conlin Road to block  the view of the complex and the truck traffic, and that that appropriate  traffic signals be installed. He further requested that water and sewer  Page 2 of 3  Public Meetings Minutes   November 09, 2020 - 7:00 PM    services be installed at his property and that the cost be borne by the  developer. In addition, Mr. MacPherson requested regular road cleaning  and washing and cleaning of his exterior property during construction on  a regular basis to maintain its present condition, that the proposed  building be set back far enough to allow for the development of a berm  and to be properly landscaped to make the view more aesthetically  pleasing and to block the view from the building. Mr. MacPherson stated  that the proposed development would limit the future sale of his  residential property and would have a detrimental impact on its value.  He noted that it would be unlikely that anyone would want to purchase a  residential property located directly across from an industrial  establishment. He stated that a potential buyer would only be interested  in his property for commercial or industrial use. Mr. MacPherson  requested assurances that the Town of Whitby would not oppose a  rezoning application for his property, that rezoning to the broadest scope  possible would be considered, and that all fees associated with such an  application would be waived and/or that the Town enter into an  agreement with the developer of the proposed development to absorb  all associated costs.  There were no further submissions from the public.  R. Saunders, Commissioner of Planning and Development, answered  questions regarding:  • the Region of Durham's water and sewer servicing plan;  • clarification on the zoning of neighbouring properties apart from  the proposed development; and,  • whether the Brooklin Secondary Plan was the reason for rezoning  property within the area.  K. Narraway, Manager of Legislative Services/Deputy Clerk, indicated  how members of the public could submit comments and be placed on  the Interested Party List regarding this matter.  The meeting adjourned at 7:39 p.m.      Page 3 of 3

Joanne Doherty, 321 Cochrane Street, appeared before Council and  raised concerns regarding her property at 2 Coronation Road in that  there was a proposed change in designation of the lands from hazard  lands to open space. Ms. Doherty stated that the change in designation  would alter how the lands are perceived and potentially the value of the  land.  She requested that the lands remain designated as hazard lands  particularly in the West Whitby area until the West Whitby connection  had been completed.  Ms. Doherty questioned whether a percentage of  her property was owned by the Town and stated that an open space  designation should be part of Town owned lands rather than private  property.  R. Short, Commissioner of Planning, stated that the lands that the Town  has in ownership would be related to the future Desmond G.

IN THE MEETING HALL OF THE WHITBY MUNICIPAL BUILDING 2. (continued) Nancy Shanks, 301 Byron St. N., appeared before Committee and asked for clarification on how the numbers were determined for intensification and if citizens can query the province on this forced growth. Ms. Shanks asked for clarification on where the residents are coming from to account for this growth and referred to the Statistics Canada website and quoted from their report. She referred to this plan as forced growth by the province and questioned the projected increase in growth figures, wondering what is the percentage of forced growth vs natural growth. Mr. Short advised we don't have that information. Ms. Shanks asked for clarification on what the highest height restriction for a building in the downtown area and questioned if the applications would be subject to public consultation. Mr. Short replied that any application that doesn't meet the Official Plan would be subject to review. Sharon Lee, 1600 Charles Street, appeared before Committee and advised that she lives in the Port Whitby area and is impressed by the Official Plan. Ms. Lee asked for clarification on the boundaries around Whitby Go Transit and Port Whitby as she feels they are not defined and queried if this is accurately looking at a true balance between all types of development. Sean Aikin, 1 Point Hope Place, appeared before Committee and asked if there is a formula for the amount of open green space in this intensification strategy and if not, should this be a rule. Mr. Short advised that in terms of the Planning Act there are provisions for parkland and the formula is varied, depending on the applications. Mr. Short advised that Whitby is statistically well-supplied. Mr. Aikin asked about traffic studies and wondered if they are based on the studies of that single project or does it consider all traffic affected throughout the town. S. Beale, Director of Public Works, said traffic studies are done on the whole study area and are based on land use, not just the project itself. Bill Irwin and Marion Irwin, 61 Prentice Drive, appeared before Committee and asked for clarification on the purpose of the Garden Street and Burns Street area. They asked for clarification on what the definition of ""other"" is as indicated in the map provided in the handouts. Rudy Heezen, 1600 Charles Street, appeared before Committee and asked for clarification on the definition of a stable neighbourhood. Mr. Heezen said he was encouraged by the input in the report from the workshops that citizens provided. Mr. Heezen said the employment of 15,000 jobs in the Port Whitby area is a challenge and wondered before we start building, do we need employment first or do we build first and then get employment. Mark Tolme, 120 Front Street East, appeared before Committee and expressed concern for the need to identify possible areas for intensification. He advised that he lived in Port Whitby, in a small stable neighbourhood and wants to ensure the single family dwellings were retained for this area.

Vera Felgemacher, 209 St. John St. W., appeared before Committee and asked if school sites will be preserved in the area and questioned whether established soccer fields and recreation areas would change. Mr. Short said the master waterfront plan is being undertaken by the Community and Marketing Services department dealing with all this land. Ms. Felgemacher asked if there are height restrictions on institutional sites and if there is a restriction on this type of development. Mr. Short said the height restriction now is eight stories and schools are generally two stories. Ms. Felgemacher asked if there are height restrictions in the downtown core. Mr. Short advised that the secondary plan sets minimum and maximum heights and has very detailed criteria. He advised there is a heritage built form in parts of the downtown that have to be explored and it may take care of this. Sharon Johnston, 340 Watson St. W., appeared before Committee and advised that in her opinion, the high density area should be classified as stable. She said it must be recognized as stable condo dwellers which are an entity unto themselves. Ms. Johnston advised that the soccer field is very busy in summer and that there is a need for parking facilities and grade improvements in the area. Chad Vernon, 1010 Dundas St. E. appeared before Committee and advised he is concerned that there has been no provision for job creation or caring for an aging population as nothing has been mentioned in the plan about servicing, such as hospitals. There being no further public submissions, the public meeting was closed. Discussion ensued amongst Committee members including a discussion about holding more public meetings in order to hear further comments from the public. RESOLUTION NO. 59-10 MOVED by Mayor Perkins 1.

The Chair indicated that comments would now be received from  members of the public who registered to speak.  Lisa Guthrie, 603 Mary Street East, stated that she and her partner own  a home on Robmar Street located just south of the proposed  development. She raised concerns about the impact of the proposed  development on the well water, noting that Robmar Street was on wells  and septic systems. Ms. Guthrie inquired whether there were measures  in place to ensure that the well water would not be impacted by the  proposed development. Ms. Guthrie raised further concerns about the  proposed development creating truck traffic on Robmar Street, noting  the number of trucks coming into the area. She stated that Robmar  Street was a quiet street and recommended that Robmar Street become  a no trucking street or that it be closed so that it could not be accessed  from Baldwin Street.

He stated the proposed development would change the area  dramatically, noting that the area around the proposed development was  all conservation and agricultural land. Mr. Anderson stated that the  proposed warehouse facility would not be consistent with the character  of the area and that it would have a negative impact on the quality of life  in the area specifically for the residents on Robmar Street. He advised  that either Robmar Street or Spencers Road were used as cut through  streets to bypass the Baldwin Street traffic congestion and that there  has already been truck traffic on Robmar Street. Mr. Anderson advised  that here would be a need for the truck traffic on Robmar Street to be  restricted. Mr. Anderson raised concerns about the well water on  Robmar Street. He noted that the proposed amount of truck parking on  the site would lead to a significant quantity of fuel, diesel, and oil leaking  from the trucks that would have an impact on the wells. He advised that  the wells would have to be monitored for an extended period of time and  that there should be a plan in place should the well water be affected.  He raised concerns about the warehouse set back only being about 200  metres between the rear of the Hydro One corridor and his back yard.  Mr. Anderson advised that the majority of trees in the area have been  removed, noting the displacement of wildlife and his property being  inundated with bird nests. He inquired about how the area would be  reforested. Mr. Anderson inquired about the need for a large warehouse  in a small area, noting that the warehouse and the Whitby Sports  Complex would create a lot of traffic near the residents.  Page 2 of 6  Public Meetings Minutes   May 30, 2022 - 7:00 PM    Mr. Jordan and Ms. Sui answered questions regarding:  •  mitigation measures pertaining to the impact of the proposed  development on the Robmar Street well water;  • whether any discussions have taken place regarding truck traffic  access to Robmar Street;  • concerns about the impact of the proposed development on the  environment, the removal of trees, and whether tree- planting/replacing would take place in the area; and,  • opportunities for discussions with residents in the area.  Staff answered questions regarding:  • whether any discussions have taken place with respect to the  concerns about truck traffic on Robmar Street;  • the timing of the construction of the Mid-Block Arterial road and  whether it would be complimentary to the construction of the  proposed building; and,  • opportunities for discussions with residents in the area to address  their concerns.  There were no further submissions from the public.  K. Narraway, Manager of Legislative Services/Deputy Clerk, indicated  how members of the public could submit comments and be placed on  the Interested Party List regarding this matter.      2.  Planning and Development (Planning Services) Department Report,  PDP 33-32  Re: Draft Plan of Subdivision and Zoning By-law Amendment  Applications, Mattamy (Brooklin) Limited, 7613 Ashburn Road, File  Numbers: DEV-06-22 (SW-2022-02, Z-04-22)  Carl Geiger, Principal Planner, provided a PowerPoint presentation  which included an overview of the applications.  Matthew Cory, representing Mattamy (Brooklin) Limited, provided a  PowerPoint presentation which included a detail overview of the  applications.  The Chair indicated that comments would now be received from  members of the public who registered to speak.  Max Lysyk, 71 Southwood Street, Oshawa, stated the he was  representing Dr. G. Lysyk, 320 Columbus Road West and 1628755  Ontario Limited, 360 Columbus Road West. He advised that the  proposed development abuts his northern property limit where the local  park was located. Mr. Lysyk stated that he was not opposed to  Page 3 of 6  Public Meetings Minutes   May 30, 2022 - 7:00 PM    development, noting that his development application would be  presented at a Public Meeting in the coming months. He raised  concerns about the proposed development's post development drainage  matching predevelopment quantities specifically related to Block 31 (the  local park) which backs onto his property line. He advised that he  believed that some drainage would be proposed through his property,  noting that he wanted to ensure that the drainage directed toward the  greenbelt or woodlot on his property would not exceed the  predevelopment levels. Mr. Lysyk indicated that he has no concerns  about the location of the Stormwater Management Pond (Block 32), but  that he wanted to ensure that the outflow from the Stormwater  Management Pond does not exceed predevelopment rates. He noted  that Lynde Creek flows through his property and that he wanted to  ensure that there would not be any potential flooding. Mr. Lysyk  commented on the development application being premature, noting  that he was still in a dispute with Lakeview Homes, the development  directly south of the proposed development, with respect to the  proposed east/west collector road centre line grades specifically related  to the grading between Ashburn Road and Cedarbrook Trail, noting that  the current grades change by approximately 20 metres. He noted that  the grades of that road would ultimately set the grades of Street A  through the Lakeview Homes development to the south, and would  ultimately impact the grades of Street A through the proposed  development. He stated that about half of the stormwater drainage for  the proposed development would flow toward the Lakeview Stormwater  Management Pond, and that there could be negative impact on his  property depending on the ultimate road grades and the design of the  two developments. Mr. Lysyk advised that he wanted to ensure that the  proposed development does not negatively impact 360 Columbus Road  West under post development conditions.  Mr. Cory answered questions regarding:  • whether consideration has been given to the pre and post  development drainage flows related to the local park and the  stormwater pond drainage;  • concerns about grading related to Ashburn Road and Cedarbrook  Trail; and,  • whether the location of the public elementary school could be  moved and mitigation measures related to the creation of noise  from the proposed school.  Staff answered questions regarding:  • opportunities to share the concerns about the location and noise  created by the school with the Durham District School Board;  • the impact of the local park and stormwater management pond  on the residents; and,  Page 4 of 6  Public Meetings Minutes   May 30, 2022 - 7:00 PM    • whether consideration would be given to the concerns about  safety around the proposed school and whether the school  property would be fenced.  There were no further submissions from the public.  K. Narraway, Manager of Legislative Services/Deputy Clerk, indicated  how members of the public could submit comments and be placed on  the Interested Party List regarding this matter.      3.

A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Mr. Fine regarding:  • the design of the signage and whether it took into account  persons with visual impairments;   • clarification about the different purposes of neighbourhood  identification signage versus wayfinding signage noting that  wayfinding signage is functional whereas neighbourhood  identification signage is a reflection of community pride;   • opportunities to identify cycling infrastructure and facilities  through signage and the level of consultation that has taken place  with the Town's Active Transportation and Safe Roads Advisory  Committee;   • confirmation that the signage system being proposed will not  contain a separate set of signs for cyclists and that cyclists will be  able to rely on vehicular signage for wayfinding;   • details about signage along the Waterfront Trail and whether or  not there will be consistency with the Regional Cycling Plan  signage recommendations;   • opportunities for unique gateway signage at entrances to  Brooklin;   • challenges associated with attempting to install neighbourhood  identification signs throughout the Town including misidentifying  neighbourhood boundaries or failing to identify specific  communities; and,   • proposed distances between wayfinding signage and if the sign  system will allow motorists to navigate from Provincial highways  to destinations without having to use a map or navigation system.

Now therefore be it resolved:  1. That the Council of the Town of Whitby requests the  Province of Ontario to require a Safe-Arrival Policy be  developed and implemented by provincially licensed child  care providers to enhance the safety of all children enrolled  in their programs by reporting unexplained child absences in  a timely manner to parents, guardians, or caregivers; and,  2.

He stated that the appellant's  dog bit the complainant's dog in the abdomen.  C. Robinson and N. Amato, the appellants, appeared before the  Committee. Mr. Robinson advised that he did not dispute the events but  felt that the process for handling the complaint and issuance of the   Animal Services Appeal Committee Minutes   March 24, 2021 - 3:00 PM    Order to Restrain was one-sided and that the investigation was carried  out unjustly.

Re: Planning and Development Department, PL 74-21  Whitby Mature Neighbourhoods Study Update - Interim Control By-laws  # 7699-20 and # 7700-20     Refer to Item 4.1, PL 74-21   Paul Lowes and Susanne MacDonald, SGL Planning and Design Inc.,  provided a PowerPoint presentation regarding the Whitby Mature  Neighbourhoods Study.

Highlights of the presentation  included:  • the need for a diverse range of housing options in Whitby;  • the replacement homes referenced in the correspondence could  not be considered affordable;  Page 3 of 22  Committee of the Whole Minutes   November 22, 2021 - 7:00 PM    • recent rebuilds have maximized the size of replacement homes  for maximum potential future profit and have not been occupied  by the original builder or owner for some time;  • the scale and design of rebuilds were often incompatible with  neighbouring homes;  • the number of mature healthy trees that would have been  removed to accommodate large new rebuilds that have an impact  on the entire neighbourhood;   • greater lot coverage, smaller permeable surface areas, and  vulnerability to climate change induced hazards; and,  • photographs and details about new and rebuilt homes located on  the east and west side of Cochrane Street, Fairview Drive, Euclid  Street, and Ferguson Street.      Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Drumm    That the rules of procedure be suspended to allow the delegation to  exceed the five minute speaking limit.     Carried    Ms. Gasser continued her delegation regarding:     • preserving the attributes and the character of Whitby's mature  neighbourhoods while allowing for gentle and appropriate  intensification that would not impact an entire neighbourhood;  and,   • the request and support for Option 1 to extend the existing  Interim Control By-laws by one year.     A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Ms. Gasser regarding clarification about Ms. Gasser's  concerns about the Town's ability to restrict the development  applications between January and the completion of the Study.    2.2  Matthew Helfand representing Toronto-Guild Investments Limited  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 74-21  Whitby Mature Neighbourhoods Study Update - Interim Control By-laws  # 7699-20 and # 7700-20    Refer to Item 4.1, PL 74-21  Page 4 of 22  Committee of the Whole Minutes   November 22, 2021 - 7:00 PM    Matthew Helfand, representing Toronto-Guild Investments Limited,  stated that he was a lawyer for Aird & Berlis LLP and counsel to the  owners of the land at 143 Garrard Road. Mr. Helfand advised that he  had appeared before Council on October 4, 2021 regarding a request  for an exemption from Interim Control By-law # 7699-20 for 143 Garrard  Road which was not approved by Council. He noted that the Staff report  provides two options, to either let the Interim Control By-laws lapse or to  extend them for an additional year. He stated that the decision to extend  the Interim Control By-laws could be appealed to the Ontario Land  Tribunal where owners and appellants would have the right to challenge  the appropriateness of the Interim Control By-laws as they apply to their  lands in terms of land use planning policies and principles. He  suggested that Council consider a third option to extend the Interim  Control By-law, and to change either its boundaries and/or its  regulations. Mr. Helfand stated that should Council extend Interim  Control By-law # 7699-20 that the by-law should be amended such that  his client's lands would no longer be subject to its provisions and  regulations. Mr. Helfand advised that in accordance with the Planning  Act the act of information gathering though a land use planning study  was integral to the purpose of the Interim Control By-laws and that it  was a basic statutory requirement. He stated that the rationale  underlying the Interim Control By-laws was to place matters into a  holding pattern while information was gathered, analyzed, and acted  upon. He advised that Council was aware of the history of his client's  lands with respect to the Ontario Land Tribunal (OLT) proceeding, the  evidence presented, and the determination of the OLT. He urged  Council to consider that the informational purpose of the statute as it  relates to the Interim Control By-law was fundamentally different from  most other properties that were captured within the restrictions of the by- law, noting that his client's lands have been studied, information has  been gathered and analyzed and it has been acted upon. Mr. Helfand  stated that an amendment to the Interim Control By-law at this stage  would be appropriate from a land use planning perspective and would  save time and resources by the Town and his client. He advised that if  the Interim Control By-law was extended and continues to apply to his  client's lands, that it would be appealed and it would be assessed by the  OLT on its own merits from a planning perspective.    3.  Correspondence    3.1  There was no correspondence.    4.  Staff Reports    4.1  Planning and Development Department, PL 74-21  Page 5 of 22  Committee of the Whole Minutes   November 22, 2021 - 7:00 PM    Re: Whitby Mature Neighbourhoods Study Update - Interim Control By- laws # 7699-20 and # 7700-20  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Staff regarding:  • the possibility of retroactively applying the proposed  recommendations arising from the Mature Neighbourhoods Study  to development applications between the lapse of the Interim  Control By-laws and Council's adoption of the recommendations;  • confirmation that development applications received between the  lapse of the Interim Control By-laws and the adoption of the  recommendations would be processed based on the Town's  current planning policies;  • confirmation that the new guidelines would be applied to  development applications received after the lapse of the Interim  Control By-laws following the adoption of the recommendation  report should the Interim Control By-laws not be extended;  • confirmation that the approval of the recommendation report  would provide Staff with direction to find a shared alignment  between Council and Staff based on the Mature Neighbourhoods  Study and the recommendation report;  • the timeline for the recommendation report to Council and for the  completion of the statutory process to implement the  recommendations;  • confirmation that Council could approve requests for exemption  from the Interim Control By-laws should the Interim Control By- laws be extended;  • deferring the decision regarding the Interim Control By-laws until  the Council meeting on November 29, 2021; and,  • the number of development applications that have not been  processed due to the restrictions of the Interim Control By-laws,  and the number of requests for exemption from Interim Control  By-laws that have been presented to Council.      Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Newman    1. That the ""Whitby Mature Neighbourhoods Options Report""  (September 2021)"" be received for information; and,  2. That Council consider the options related to Interim Control By- laws # 7699-20 and # 7700-20, as outlined within Section 4.3 of  report PL 74-21.     Page 6 of 22  Committee of the Whole Minutes   November 22, 2021 - 7:00 PM    Carried later in the meeting (See following motions)    Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Newman    That the main motion be amended to replace Item 2 and include Item 3  as follows:  2. That Staff be directed to proceed with Phase 3 of the Mature  Neighbourhoods Study to provide Council with recommendations  on the options to amend the relevant planning regulations and  guidelines through the Planning and Design Recommendations  Report; and,  3. That the decision regarding Interim Control By-laws # 7699-20  and # 7700-20 be deferred to the November 29th Council  meeting to receive further legal advice on this matter.    Carried    The main motion, as amended, was then carried as follows:    Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Newman    1. That the ""Whitby Mature Neighbourhoods Options Report""  (September 2021)"" be received for information;  2. That Staff be directed to proceed with Phase 3 of the Mature  Neighbourhoods Study to provide Council with recommendations  on the options to amend the relevant planning regulations and  guidelines through the Planning and Design Recommendations  Report; and,  3. That the decision regarding Interim Control By-laws # 7699-20  and # 7700-20 be deferred to the November 29th Council  meeting to receive further legal advice on this matter.     Carried  5.

Delegations    7.1  Astrid Poei  Community Services Department Report, CMS 19-21  Re: Unnamed West Whitby Park – Park Name Survey Results      Refer to Item 9.1, CMS 19-21  Astrid Poei, 68 Westfield Drive, commented on the process being flawed  for how the names for the park were selected and the dismissal of the  feedback from the public. She advised that if the names presented by  Staff required a vote by the public that those names would automatically  rank higher than any other suggested names. Ms. Poei stated that the  alternate suggested park names were not made public and could not be  voted on. She further stated that initially there was not any consultation  with the public, that the original proposed name for the park was Des  Newman District Park, and that following consultation with the public the  proposed name for the park remained as Des Newman District Park  despite that fact that it was not compliant with the Town's Municipal  Property and Facility Naming Policy. She advised that the park should  be given a name that was neutral and that everyone would be proud of.  Ms. Poei noted that there were several things named after Des Newman  and that should everything be named after former mayors that it would  not leave any room for recognition of future leaders from diverse  backgrounds.   A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Mr. Poei regarding whether the delegate would support  a compromise in naming the park Des Newman Whit-BEE Park.  It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 9.1, CMS 19-21, at  this time.      7.2  Aida Sorescu  Re: Legal and Enforcement Services Department Report, LS 18-21  Proposed Unauthorized Area Parking By-law     Page 8 of 22  Committee of the Whole Minutes   November 22, 2021 - 7:00 PM    Refer to Item 9.6, LS 18-21  Aida Sorescu, 16 Hallmark Way, raised concerns about vehicles parked  on front lawns in her neighbourhood, noting that it was a problem that  was not being dealt with promptly, that it would continue and that it  would eventually deface the neighbourhood. Ms. Sorescu advised that  she wanted to have her voice heard by Council who may not be aware  of the impact of vehicles parked on front lawns have on a  neighbourhood. She stated that parking on the front lawns of properties  was prevalent in a certain type of neighbourhood where there was only  singe car garage and a short, narrow single car driveway. Ms. Sorescu  advised that parking vehicles on front lawns, was unlawful, unsightly,  harmful to the property, that it creates mud piles on the property that  gets tracked onto the roads requiring resources to clean the roads, that  it devalues the properties in the neighbourhood, and that it was a bad  habit that spreads by example throughout a neighbourhood. She stated  that this type of situation creates tension and resentment between  neighbours because the majority of residents take pride in the  ownership of their properties.      Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Newman    That the rules of procedure be suspended to allow the delegation to  exceed the five minute speaking limit.     Carried    Ms. Sorescu continued her delegation and advised that a recent  complaint was made to the Town and that Staff did not prosecute  because the matter was difficult to enforce. She stated that by-laws  were not taken seriously without proper enforcement.

Saunders, Commissioner of Planning and Development  F. Santaguida, Commissioner of Legal and Enforcement  Services/Town Solicitor  K. Narraway, Manager of Legislative Services/Deputy Clerk   H. Ellis, Council and Committee Coordinator  L. MacDougall, Council and Committee Coordinator (Recording  Secretary)  _____________________________________________________________________    1.  Public Meetings - 7:00 p.m.     K. Narraway, Manager of Legislative Services/Deputy Clerk, advised that the  Public Meetings are being held in a hybrid meeting format with members of the  public attending both in-person and virtually. Mr. Narraway stated that Members  of Council would receive a written record of all submissions upon publication of  the minutes of the Public Meetings. Mr. Narraway provided an overview of the  format of the public meetings. He advised that members of the public who wish to  be notified of the next report related to any of the public meetings or who wish to  be placed on an Interested Parties List for a matter should email the Town's  Planning and Development Department at planning@whitby.ca or call  905.430.4306.  1.  PDP 03-23, Planning and Development (Planning Services) Department  Report  Re: Zoning By-law Amendment Application, Inuka Developer Inc., 1  Ferguson Avenue, File Number: DEV-25-22, (Z-17-22)   Lauren Taylor, Planner II, provided a PowerPoint Presentation which  included an overview of the application.       2  Dave Meredith, representing Inuka Developer Inc., provided a verbal  presentation which included a detailed overview of the application.  The Chair indicated that comments would now be received by members of  the public.  Brenda Balment, Resident, stated that she was speaking on behalf of  Mainstreet Brooklin Neighbourhood Association (MBNA). She advised that  her understanding of the need for the MBNA to incorporate was a  requirement by the Town based on the MBNA's legal relationship with the  Condominium Corporation due to the sharing of specific services and  assets of the condominium site for which a monthly service fee was paid.  Ms. Balment advised that the MBNA consists of 25 free hold units that  back onto Heber Down Crescent with frontage on Harvey Johnston Way.  She stated that the free hold units were located adjacent to the two  condominium buildings backing onto Winchester Road and the proposed  development. Ms. Balment stated that the Region and the Town have  identified the subject property as an intensification area. She cited her  understanding of an 'intensification area' and inquired whether any  consideration was given to the preservation of the MBNA's village. Ms.  Balment stated that the style of the buildings in the proposed development  would not complement the existing housing in the neighbourhood. She  indicated that there was not any need to include commercial/retail on the  site right in the middle of a residential neighbourhood, noting that when  the traffic lights were installed at Winchester Road and Ferguson Avenue  and the development on the south side of Winchester Road was complete  that there would be access to plenty of commercial and retail  opportunities. Ms. Balment inquired whether the proposed development  was considered high density. She raised concerns where vehicles would  park, noting that the proposed development already has a deficiency of 5  surface parking spaces, that there would only be 1.25 parking spaces for  each of the 60 residential units, and that most residential unit dwellings  would have two vehicles. Ms. Balment raised safety concerns with respect  to emergency vehicle access into and out of the proposed development  given that there was one entry/exit. She raised concerns about parking  and increased traffic on Heber Down Crescent that would result from the  proposed residential and commercial/retail units. Ms. Balment raised  further concerns about the use of Harvey Johnston Way as a short cut  through the existing community, noting that Harvey Johnston Way was a  private road and that the residents in the existing development were  responsible for all maintenance and repairs. Ms. Balment cited an excerpt       3  from By-law # 1784 regarding the erection of any building or structure on a  lot that fronts onto an improved public street, noting that there have not  been any improvements to Heber Down Crescent for 12 years. She  advised that the current proposed plan indicates that there would be eight  semi-detached dwellings fronting onto Heber Down Crescent, noting that  the reversal of the semi-detached dwellings to back onto Heber Down  Crescent would make them aesthetically pleasing and more consistent  with the existing townhouses on Harvey Johnston Way. Ms. Balment  raised concerns about increased noise and emission levels due to the  proposed development, and about residents from the proposed  development encroaching on private property to use the parkette and  playground due to the only open space in the proposed development  being located on roof-tops. Ms. Balment recommended that Heber Down  Crescent be designated as no street parking, and that a clause related to  no encroachment on Harvey Johnston Way be incorporated into the  purchase agreements for the condominiums and semi-detached units.  She noted that clause would mean that vehicle traffic would not be  allowed to cut through the development to avoid traffic on Heber Down  Crescent, that there would not be any access to the open space  playground, and that there would not be any use of the parking spaces in  the MBNA's existing development.  Dean Holtby, Resident, stated that he lives directly across from the  proposed development and that the 8 semi-detached dwellings and the  driveway exiting the complex would be facing his property.  Mr. Holtby  stated that the plan indicated that there would be 16 parking spaces  between the driveways and garages, noting that the size of the garages  were approximately 10 feet long by 20 feet wide. He advised that the  semi-detached dwellings would be 3 storeys in height and would likely  attract younger residents who would likely have 2 vehicles per residence.   Mr. Holtby stated that the garages were so small that there probably would  not be enough room for a vehicle, resulting in vehicles parked on Heber  Down Crescent directly in front of his property.  Marie Richardson, Resident, stated that residents have not been informed  about traffic control at the Winchester Road and Ferguson Avenue  intersection. She suggested that the developer remove all commercial  space from the proposed plan due to increased traffic concerns. Ms.  Richardson stated that westbound on Winchester Road is a right turning  lane for Ferguson Avenue and suggested that the developer consider  right-in/right-out access onto Winchester Road. She further stated that the       4  proposed eight semi-detached dwellings should have internal driveways  rather than driveways onto Heber Down Crescent. Ms. Richardson  suggested that the developer to consider a three-storey condo building to  stay in keeping with the condos on the adjoining property to the east.  Andy Barrington, Resident, provided a Power Point presentation.  Highlights of the presentation included:   concerns about the commercial component of the proposed  development resulting in increased traffic volume well beyond that  of the residential component;   safety concerns for pedestrians and cyclists;   concerns about reduced sightlines for vehicles entering onto  Winchester Road due to the residential/commercial building;   an increase in the volume of speeding vehicles making right turns  from Ferguson Street to Heber Down due to the shallow angle of  the intersection;   an excerpt from the 2016 Ferguson Avenue Class Environmental  Assessment Study which presented an option to close Ferguson  Avenue just south of Heber Down Crescent;   the suggestion of a modified version of Option 7 from the 2016  study which would, provide land for other possible uses including a  park, parking, greenspace, and housing, solve traffic issues and  improve road safety on Ferguson Avenue and Heber Down  Crescent, and eliminate the impact of future traffic volume in the  entire Meadowcrest neighbourhood from the commercial district  currently under construction south of Winchester Road/Highway 7.  Dave Meredith and Staff answered questions regarding:   traffic infiltration into the surrounding neighbourhood and on-street  parking;   the sidewalk location on the south side of Heber Down Crescent;   the number of parking spaces within the proposed development;   issues pertaining to internalizing the driveways;   the intersection at Highway 7/Ferguson Avenue and access to the  Winash Development; and,       5   options for the intersection at this location.  There were no further submissions from the public.  2.

Brayden Libawski, representing 2738183 Ontario Inc., provided a  PowerPoint presentation which included a detailed overview of the  applications.  The Chair indicated that comments would now be received by members of  the public.  Rick Sidler, Resident, raised concerns about the impact of the  development on the value of his property and stated that the proposed  building would be located directly in front of his windows. Mr. Sidler raised  concerns regarding the zoning and whether the residential zoning of the  severed lot would impact the mixed-use zoning of his property.  Staff answered questions regarding:   the zoning of the proposed severed lot and surrounding properties;  and,   the heritage status of 3 Cassels Road.       6  David Breen, Resident, requested images of the proposed development  and stated that the fence between the subject land and his property was  not on the property line.  Brayden Libawski answered questions regarding:   renderings of the proposed building; and,   the process for addressing the fence line issue through reviewing  land surveys.  There were no further submissions from the public.  The meeting adjourned at 8:26 p.m.
