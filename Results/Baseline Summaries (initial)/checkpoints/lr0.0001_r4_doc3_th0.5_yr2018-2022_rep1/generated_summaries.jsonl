S. Haslam asked the applicant if the            on-site parking will     remain the same.  O. Kemal responded, stating that the existing on-site parking will                   remain un-altered.

The proposed dwelling would occupy approximately 32.5%  of the lot area, whereas the remaining requested lot coverage would be used to  accommodate a future accessory structure should the future home owner seek to  construct one.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  S. Haslam asked the applicant if he has satisfied the requirements from the Policy and  Heritage Planning Department.  S. DeNoble advised the Committee that the requirements of the Policy and Heritage  Planning Department has been partially satisfied, however, he is just awaiting on the  approval of the building material colour packages.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that no correspondence was received.   Minutes of the 3rd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.  Moved by: B.

The application is for permission to reduce the minimum required interior side yard  setback from 4.3m to 3.5m where no garage or carport is provided on the lot.

The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  A. Downs introduced himself to the Committee as the owner of the subject property. He  advised the Committee that he has owned the property for 23 years. He noted that the  property includes a small detached bungalow with no formal front entry, just a side door.  He expressed to the Committee that he would like to enclose the existing covered porch  within the side yard which would allow him to create a more formal and aesthetically  pleasing entranceway to the dwelling.  A. Downs noted that the existing driveway provides access to the rear yard, and the  requested variance if approved would not impact the movement of his vehicles to the  rear yard parking area.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  B. O'Carroll asked what the exterior finish will be for the enclosed porch.  A. Downs replied that the finish will be a high quality board and batten siding.  D. McCarroll asked the applicant if there is an existing addition at the rear of the  dwelling currently.  A.

Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that no correspondence was received.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.  Moved by: B. O'Carroll  That the application to reduce the minimum required interior side yard setback from  4.3m to 3.5m where no garage or car port is provided on the lot located at 115 Bell  Drive be Granted.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variance is  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Item 3:  Public Hearings  A/60/19  Nadeem Irfan on behalf of Barakaa Developer Inc.  160 Hillcrest Drive  The application was originally heard by the Committee of Adjustment at the July 25,  2019 meeting and was tabled pending the final and binding decision of the Durham  Region Land Division Committee with regards to the associated Land Division  Application. At this time the Land Division Application has been appealed to the Local  Planning Appeal Tribunal (LPAT).  The applicant has requested that the subject tabled application be brought back before  the Committee of Adjustment for consideration at the March 5, 2020 Committee  meeting.  The application is for permission to reduce the minimum required lot frontage for a  single detached dwelling from 15.0m to 11.8m.  The subject property is located at 160 Hillcrest Drive and is zoned Residential Type 2  Zone in the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 2585.  The requested variance is required to facilitate the severance of the subject property  into two parcels and to permit the development of a single detached residential dwelling  on the severed portion of the subject property (Part 1).  In Support of Application  Raj Kehar (Solicitor)  In Opposition of Application  Paul Richardson  Stephen Jimmo  Jennifer Jimmo  Linda Richardson  John Lafleur  Al Armstrong  Bernadette Riordan  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  R. Kehar introduced himself to the Committee as the solicitor retained by the applicant.  He noted that the requested minor variance application is seeking only one variance  from the provisions of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law as it relates to the minimum  required lot frontage.  R. Kehar stated that there are two types of applications applicable to the subject  property; a consent application to sever the property and this minor variance application  to seek relief from the minimum required lot frontage. He noted that the consent   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  application which was submitted to the Region of Durham was approved, but had been  appealed by a local resident. An appeal hearing with the LPAT was scheduled, but was  adjourned pending the outcome of the minor variance application. In the event that the  minor variance application was appealed, the LPAT could consider both applications  concurrently.  R. Kehar proceeded to circulate an information package to the Committee members.  R. Kehar expressed that during the first Committee of Adjustment meeting to consider  this application a recommendation from the Town's Planning Department was not  provided. He noted that Planning Staff has now provided a recommendation, and it is in  favour of the variance.  R. Kehar asked the Committee to refer to the information package. He referred to a  figure that depicted the severed property. R. Kehar concluded that the proposed  dwelling as illustrated complied with all zone provisions, except for the minimum  required lot frontage.  R. Kehar stated that in his view the subject property is oversized in comparison to the  lots in the surrounding neighbourhood. He also noted that there is a wide range of lot  frontages within the surrounding area which range from 9.0m to 29.0m.  R. Kehar spoke to the Provincial Policy Statement and the Place to Grow Plan, and how  the requested variance represents a modest form of intensification and meets the intent  of these policy documents.  R. Kehar also spoke to the Town of Whitby Official Plan. He noted that the property is  designated Residential and this land use permits a range of housing types. Reducing  the minimum required lot frontage to permit two dwellings on the subject property will  increase affordability and housing choices.  R. Kehar advised the Committee that the intent and purpose of the minimum required  lot frontage provision is meant to maintain the character and to ensure that the proposal  is compatible with the neighbourhood. He noted that the Planning Department  undertook a lot frontage analysis for the residential lots within 200m of the subject  property and lot frontages ranged from 9.0m to 29.0m.  R. Kehar also referenced the planning staff report with regards to the interpretation of  compatibility. He agrees with planning staffs interpretation of compatibility.  R. Kehar concluded that the requested variance is minor in nature and would result in  the appropriate development of the property.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  S. Haslam expressed that the subject property is large, and asked why the minimum  required setback could not be complied with.  R. Kehar replied that the proposed dwelling complies with all required yard setbacks.  The only zoning deficiency is with regards to the minimum required lot frontage. He also   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  stated that if the property were not to be severed, a very large home could be  constructed which would be out of character for the neighbourhood.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that two letters of objection were received from Al  Armstrong and Bernadette Riordan and had been circulated to the Committee prior to  the meeting.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.  P. Richardson introduced himself to the Committee as the owner of 161 Hillcrest Drive.  He expressed that he does not agree with the rationale provided by the applicant's  solicitor. He also noted that the 9.0m wide lots as referenced previously are located on  Harris Court and it is not appropriate to use these lots as a comparison.  P. Richardson circulated photos of Hillcrest Drive to the Committee. He noted that the  only 12.2m (40ft) wide lots on Hillcrest Drive are a select few corner lots. He stated that  the physical character of the street is primarily made up of 1 storey dwellings and the  only homes that have been enlarged in size are homes with building additions.  P. Richardson noted that the Official Plan states that new lots shall be compatible with  other lots in the neighbourhood. In his opinion the variance would result in a lot that is  not compatible with the neighbourhood.  P. Richardson also expressed his concerns with parking. He stated that kids frequently  walk down the street and the proposed driveway is much smaller than the other  driveways in the area.  P. Richardson stated that in his opinion the requested variance is not minor in nature.  The Chair asked R. Kehar if he had any further comments.  R. Kehar expressed that neighbourhoods naturally go through rejuvenation and change.  He also noted that the Zoning By-law already permits a 2 storey dwelling to be  constructed on the property, and there is currently an existing 2 storey dwelling on the  abutting property to the north.  The Chair asked if there were any further questions from the Committee.  D. McCarroll asked if there is any intent to include an accessory apartment within the  proposed dwelling.  R. Kehar replied that it is his understanding that no accessory apartment is proposed.  However, the Planning Act would permit an accessory apartment unit within the dwelling  as of right.  D. McCarroll asked how the municipal trees located in the boulevard may be impacted.   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  R. Kehar replied that an arborist report will be prepared to ensure that the trees are  protected during construction. He also noted that the staff report includes a condition  which reflects the desired preservation of the boulevard trees.  P. Richardson noted that the existing boulevard trees will likely be impacted based on  the applicant's proposal. He also asked how many parking spaces would be required for  the dwelling.  J. Taylor replied that a minimum two parking spaces would be required for a single  detached dwelling. The applicant has illustrated a two car garage on their concept plan  as well as an additional two parking spaces on the driveway.  J. Taylor also noted that an accessory apartment is permitted in any of the dwellings  located on Hillcrest Drive subject to meeting certain provisions as outlined within the  Zoning By-law.  J. Jimmo expressed to the Committee that she is not concerned about the height of the  proposed dwelling, but rather the reduced lot frontage.  Moved by: S. Haslam  That the application to reduce the minimum required lot frontage for a single detached  dwelling from 15.0m to 11.8m located at 160 Hillcrest Drive (Part 1) be Denied.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variance is  not minor in nature.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report, oral submissions,  and written submission had an effect on the Committee's decision.

R. Kehar introduced himself to the Committee and advised that the comments that he  previously provided for application A/60/19 are also applicable to this application.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that two letters of objection were received from Al  Armstrong and Bernadette Riordan and had been circulated to the Committee prior to  the meeting.   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.  The Chair asked the members of the public if their comments are the same with respect  to application A/60/19. The members of the public noted that their previous comments  are applicable to this application.  Moved by: S. Haslam  That the application to reduce the minimum required lot frontage for a single detached  dwelling from 15.0m to 11.8m located at 160 Hillcrest Drive (Part 2) be Denied.

Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Item 3:  Public Hearings  A/13/20  Curtis De Souza  1465 Byron Street South  An application has been received from Curtis De Souza, for a variance from the  provisions of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 2585.  The application is for permission to reduce the minimum required width of a two-way  driveway leading to a parking area within the rear yard from 6.0m to 4.1m.  The subject property is located at 1465 Byron Street South and is zoned Residential  Type 4 (R4) within the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 2585.  The requested variance is required to permit the construction of 2 dwelling units within  the basement of the existing converted dwelling house.  In Support of Application  Curtis De Souza  In Opposition of Application  None at this time  Also in Attendance  Vicky Zucaro  Frank Zucaro  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.

He advised the  Committee that the property currently includes a two storey converted dwelling with a  three bedroom unit on the second storey and a two bedroom unit on the main floor. He  is proposing to add two additional dwelling units within the basement.  C. De Souza noted that he will be removing the existing detached garage located in the  rear yard, and constructing a parking area for five vehicles.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  B. O'Carroll asked the applicant if the neighbouring building located at 1467 Byron  Street South is also a multi-tenant building.  F. Zucaro replied that this is his property and that the building is a multi-tenant building.  B. O'Carroll stated that she had no further comments.  The Chair asked the applicant to confirm that the detached garage will be removed.  C. De Souza replied yes.   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  The Chair asked the applicant if anyone is living in the building now.  C. De Souza replied no.  The Chair asked J.

She further advised that the tower  would increase cellular coverage in the rural area and the adjacent  community to the northeast, and provided a coalition opportunity for  cellular carriers to utilize a singular tower. Ms. Avanse stated that  Shared Tower Corp. did not send out public notifications as there were  no private properties within the 195 metre notification radius.

The application is for permission to reduce the minimum required rear yard setback  from 7.5m to 5.25m.  The subject property is located at 47 Swordfish Drive and is zoned Low Density (LD)  within the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  The requested variance is required to permit the development of a two storey detached  dwelling on the subject property.  In Support of Application  R. Vink (Applicant)  In Opposition of Application  No one in attendance  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  R. Vink introduced himself to the Committee and provided an overview of the property  location and requested variance to reduce the minimum required rear yard setback. He  advised the Committee that the property is irregular in shape and in order to  accommodate an appropriate dwelling size on the property a variance is required for a  portion of the rear yard setback. He also expressed that the resulting rear yard amenity  space would be larger than most of surrounding rear yards and the proposed dwelling is  modest in size.   The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  J. Cardwell asked the applicant if this is the only lot that requires a variance.   R. Vink replied yes. He noted that this is the only lot with an irregular lot line which  resulted in the requirement of a rear yard setback variance.  J. Cardwell asked if this variance would also permit a rear yard deck.   R. Vink replied that the dwelling will be at grade and if a future deck were to be  constructed, a variance would not be required.

Malfara advised the Committee that no correspondence was received and there was  no one from the public in attendance wishing to speak to the application.   B. O'Carroll noted that CLOCA has provided comments as noted in the Staff Report and  asked if these should included as conditions of approval.   J. Malfara replied that these comments related to the payment of a review fee as well as  grading review. The grading review is typically conducted at the building permit stage,  but should the Committee agree to include these comments as formal conditions, they  may do so.   J. Malfara advised the applicant that he should consult directly with CLOCA as it relates  to the payment of their application review fee.  Moved by: B. O'Carroll  That the application to reduce the minimum required rear yard setback from 7.5m to  5.25m located at 47 Swordfish Drive be Granted.

Lot 21, Concession 5 (Northwest Corner of Thickson Road  North and Highway 407) \u2013 File No. Z-03-22  Page 1 of 7  Public Meetings Minutes   September 12, 2022 - 7:00 PM    Justin Malfara, Planner II, provided a PowerPoint presentation which  included an overview of the application.

Michael Larkin and Daniel Ceron, representing EJB Holdings Inc.,  advised that they were in attendance to answer questions.  The Chair indicated that comments would now be received from  members of the public who registered to speak.  Donna Bonk, Resident, stated that the rear of her property abuts the  subject property. Ms. Bonk raised concerns about existing water  drainage onto her property due to the difference in the grade of the two  properties. She stated that the changes in grading of the property to  accommodate the proposed parking areas would result in additional  water drainage onto her property. She stated that there were not any  ditches or drainage on the property and that there should be drainage  from the property out to either Chestnut Street or Maple Street. Ms.  Bonk noted that a drain already exists on Chestnut Street and that a  ditch could be dug at that location.  Mr. Larkin, Mr. Ceron and Staff answered questions regarding:  \u2022 concerns about drainage from the proposed development; and,  \u2022 confirmation that the proponent would contact the delegate to  review the drainage issue.

Candace Hood, John Corbett, Kasra Eslahchi, and Majiid Tavaloki,  representing Corbett Land Strategies Inc. c/o 11250396 Canada Inc.,  provided a PowerPoint presentation which included a detailed overview  of the applications.  The Chair indicated that comments would now be received from  members of the public who registered to speak.  Susan Shahmurat, representing the Durham Condo Corporation 84,  stated that she was in support of increased density in the downtown  core because it would sustain a more viable downtown. Ms. Shahmurat  advised that she was pleased to learn that the lower floors of the  proposed building would be red brick and would complement the  historical aspects of Downtown Whitby. She raised concerns about the  height of the proposed apartment building, noting that an 11-storey  building does not comply with the existing standards of the Downtown  Whitby Secondary Plan which restricts building height to 6 storeys in the  downtown core and 8 storeys outside of the downtown core. Ms.  Shahmurat raised concerns about the loss of privacy and sunlight and  inquired about whether the plan indicated a reduction of sunlight on  neighbouring residences. She stated that the Metrolinx Bus Rapid  Transit (BRT) Project would result in an increase of traffic on downtown  residential streets due to the overflow of traffic from Dundas Street. Ms.  Shahmurat inquired about whether a study had been undertaken to  understand the flow of traffic that would increase as a result of the  proposed 125 residential units. She stated that the vehicular access on  Brock Street North was located at the existing left turn onto Mary Street  West, and inquired about whether a study had been undertaken to  understand the impact of the increased traffic at this intersection and  how traffic would be managed with a left turn lane. Ms. Shahmurat  advised that she understood that there would be the same number of  parking spaces as residential units and inquired about requiring less  parking spaces to encourage public transit use. She asked about  Page 3 of 7  Public Meetings Minutes   September 12, 2022 - 7:00 PM    whether there was a plan to contribute to a healthy and green downtown  environment by planting trees along Brock Street and whether the roof  of the building would be green. Ms. Shahmurat stated that the existing  asphalt would be covered, but that the building itself was hardscaped  and inquired about landscaping. She inquired about the use of the  mezzanine and whether it would be located indoors or outdoors. Ms.  Shahmurat stated she understood that two buildings located at 150 and  152 Brock Street North would be retained, and inquired about whether  they would be maintained to improve both the appearance and safety of  the buildings.   Ms. Hood, Mr. Corbett, Mr. Eslahchi, and Mr. Tavaloki answered  questions regarding:  \u2022 whether a Shadow Study has been completed, and opportunities  for discussion with the Condominium Corporation to address  concerns about shadows and sunlight;  \u2022 whether a Traffic Study has been completed and the impact of  the proposed development on traffic in the downtown core;  \u2022 the impact of the Metrolinx Bus Rapid Transit Project on the  proposed development and traffic as it relates to left turns;  \u2022 whether consideration has been given to sustainability measures  within the proposed development;  \u2022 the intended use of and location of the mezzanine; and,  \u2022 whether maintenance related to their appearance and safety  would take place on the heritage buildings located at 150 and 152  Brock Street North.   Staff answered questions regarding:  \u2022 confirmation of receipt of a Shadow Study and a Transportation  Study and that both studies would be made available to the  public;  \u2022 opportunities for ongoing communications with the proponents to  address the concerns raised; and,  \u2022 following up with the owners of 150 and 152 Brock Street North to  ensure that the buildings were brought into a safe condition.  Mary Marlow, Resident, noted that the proponent mentioned minimizing  the impact of the proposed development on the community and  requested that the proponent provide clarification about what minimizing  the impact means. Ms. Marlow stated that there were three historical  buildings located on the subject property and that all three buildings  should be preserved.  Ms. Hood, Mr. Corbett, Mr. Eslahchi, and Mr. Tavaloki answered  questions regarding:  Page 4 of 7  Public Meetings Minutes   September 12, 2022 - 7:00 PM    \u2022 clarification on the term minimizing the impact of the proposed  development; and,  \u2022 the retention of two heritage buildings and whether the  preservation of the heritage building located at 148 Brock Street  North would be reviewed.  Nadine Wilkes, Resident, raised concerns about the proposed  apartment building height, noting that there would be a lack of privacy  and sunlight due to the proposed building overlooking her rear yard. She  advised that she was not in support of the 11-storey apartment building  and that the proposed development would not be appropriate in the area  due to its height and size. Ms. Wilkes noted that she currently receives  sunlight in her back yard in the morning, and that she has a garden and  pool in the back yard.  Murray Visser, Resident, stated that he was not opposed to  development, but that he had concerns about traffic issues. Mr. Visser  noted that there was an exit from the proposed development onto Elm  Street which was a westbound, one-way street which may be helpful to  the community. He noted that the left turn northbound where traffic was  only one lane was already problematic due to the way Elm Street  functions in that area. He inquired about whether the entrance into the  property from Brock Street North would be both right and left turn in or  right turn only from the southbound lane.  Ms. Hood, Mr. Corbett, Mr. Eslahchi, and Mr. Tavaloki, answered a  question regarding whether access to the proposed development from  Brock Street North would be a left and right turn or a right turn only.  Mary Ellen McQuay, Resident, commented on the proposed application  for an 11-storey apartment building and the various impacts it would  have on the community. She inquired about the rationale for the Town to  consider an 11-storey building that would be twice as high as what was  permitted in the existing by-law.   Staff answered questions regarding:  \u2022 the rationale and requirement to consider the proposed 11-storey  apartment building; and,  \u2022 the timeline for a recommendation report to Council and whether  the community would be included in the process.  Rick McDonnell, Resident, advised that for many years there has been a  focus on protecting the key downtown heritage buildings and creating an  atmosphere of walkability, openness, and maintaining the feel and  character of the area. Mr. McDonnell noted that the proposed 11-storey  apartment building would not be appropriate in the downtown heritage  area. He noted that previous delegates raised valid concerns, noting  Page 5 of 7  Public Meetings Minutes   September 12, 2022 - 7:00 PM    that nearby heritage buildings have never been in such shadowing, the  importance of protecting the heritage building stock and the character of  the downtown. Mr. McDonnell commented on various steps taken by the  Town to improve Downtown Whitby including fa\u00e7ade improvement  grants, beautifying the streets, tree planting, and installing benches. He  stated that the development of Brock Street Brewery was an example of  a beautiful building that was in a suitable location in Downtown Whitby.  K.

She emphasized that  implicit/explicit bias training should focus on the needs of the  community. Ms. Reid strongly recommended that the Town of Whitby  hire a Diversity Officer.   A question and answer period ensued between Ms. Reid and the  Committee regarding:  \u2022 the steps other municipalities have taken in order to form a  subcommittee that addresses anti-black and systemic racism;  \u2022 whether external experts may offer their support on a volunteer  basis, or if they should receive financial compensation; and,  \u2022 research conducted that may help inform the actions and  decisions of a DIAC subcommittee.      2.2  Akuah Frempong, Angela Todd Anderson, Judy Douglas, and Vanessa  Reid representing the Congress of Black Women, Oshawa/Whitby  Chapter  Re: The Potential Formation of an Anti-Black Racism Subcommittee of  the Whitby Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Committee (DIAC)  Akuah Frempong, Angela Todd Anderson, and Judy Douglas,  representing the Congress of Black Women, Oshawa/Whitby Chapter,  appeared before the Committee to express their support for potentially  implementing mandatory training for Town Staff, Council and Town   boards and advisory committee members.

In Support of Application  Samir Hinnawi (Applicant)   In Opposition of Application  Brian Medeiros  Domenic Carello  Mary Carello  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  S. Hinnawi introduced himself to the Committee as the applicant and designer retained  by the owner of the subject property.

Hinnawi  further expressed that the proposed structures comply with all zoning provisions, except  for lot coverage.  S.

The Chair asked if there were any questions of the Committee.  B. O'Carroll expressed that she has no issue with the proposed building addition or size  and location of the shed. She expressed that prior to the redevelopment of the subject   Minutes of the 8th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   property, a shed similar in size existed at the rear of the property, similar in location to  where the applicant is proposing the new shed.  D. McCarroll agreed with B. O'Carroll's comments and noted that in his opinion the  proposed building addition and shed will not afford any visual impacts on abutting land  uses.  The Chair asked the applicant to confirm if the proposed shed will be located within a  section of the rear yard (north east) that prior to the redevelopment of the site included a  similar sized shed.  S. Hinnawi replied yes.  D. McCarroll asked the applicant if he can construct the shed and building addition  without the coverage variance.  S. Hinnawi replied no. The existing dwelling occupies all of the permitted lot coverage.  The Chair asked if the proposed addition to the dwelling will increase the existing height  of the dwelling.  S. Hinnawi replied no. He noted that the building addition to the rear of the existing  garage will blend into the existing roof line.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.  Moved by: D. McCarroll  That the application to increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 25.5% to  29.1% located at 97 Queen Street be Granted subject to the following conditions:  1.

Delegations    3.1  Gabriella Kalapos, Clean Air Partnership (Virtual Attendance)   Re: Office of the Chief Administrative Officer Report, CAO 17-22  Whitby Climate Emergency Response Plan \u2013 Phase 1: Resilience     Refer to Item 4.3, CAO 17-22  Gabriella Kalapos, Clean Air Partnership, stated that the Whitby Climate  Emergency Response Plan was a comprehensive plan, and that it was  obvious that significant input from a variety of stakeholders was included  Page 4 of 10  Special Council Minutes   September 26, 2022 - 5:00 PM    in the plan. Ms. Kalapos indicated that the plan clearly lays out the need  for action, the actions that need to be implemented to increase Whitby's  resilience to impacts of climate change into the future, and all the  partners that need to be engaged in the implementation. She advised  that the climate change actions within the plan, including new  development being restricted from flood zones, were practical and  forward-thinking, and provide an excellent example to municipalities in  Ontario. Ms. Kalapos noted that following Hurricane Hazel, a policy was  implemented that no development would take place on the flood plain  that was determined on all the areas that Hurricane Hazel flooded. She  stated that she had researched the avoided costs resulting from the  Hurricane Hazel land use policy, noting that the emphasis was on the  incurred cost and not on identifying the avoided costs through  preventative policies. She advised that development pressures come  from the municipality's own development decisions and from the  development decisions of surrounding municipalities noting the increase  in the percentage of land moving from permeable to impermeable. Ms.  Kalapos stated that there was no doubt that existing developments need  to be retrofitted to reduce their vulnerability to flooding. She advised that  increasing the resilience of gray infrastructure to flood risk would be  critical. She indicated that municipalities need more green infrastructure  and increasing the opportunity for green infrastructure to combine with  gray infrastructure to reduce costs, noting that should all investments be  allocated to gray infrastructure reducing the flood risk would be  expensive, and it would also reduce opportunities for the co-benefits of  both gray and green infrastructure. Ms. Kalapos advised that we need  our governments to make decisions to enable us to avoid future flood  risks and costs, noting that the Whitby Climate Emergency Response  Plan was active, proactive, and preventative.       3.2  Jack Wong, Brooklin North Landowner's Group (Virtual Attendance)   Re: Office of the Chief Administrative Officer Report, CAO 17-22  Whitby Climate Emergency Response Plan \u2013 Phase 1: Resilience     Refer to Item 4.3, CAO 17-22  Jack Wong, Malone Givens, Parsons, representing Brooklin North  Landowner's Group, stated that he has participated in the public  engagement process since last year and previously provided comments  and concerns to the Town regarding some of the assumptions and  methodology as they relate to the flood modelling and stormwater  management controls. Mr. Wong advised that during a recent meeting  with Town Staff, that discussion took place regarding his concerns and  next steps. He advised that Staff confirmed that the Whitby Climate  Emergency Response Plan would be used as a guiding document and  Page 5 of 10  Special Council Minutes   September 26, 2022 - 5:00 PM    that it was not intended to become policy. He stated that he was in  support and agreement with the intent of the plan to be used as a  guiding document and not implemented as policy as confirmed by Staff.    4.

Mrs. Nijhawan stated that the subject land was currently zoned as a  Prestige Employment Zone and that it specifically excluded storage  facilities. She advised that the commercial/residential landowners who  purchased surrounding properties were aware of the current zoning on  the site. Mrs. Nijhawan raised concerns about sustainable employment  in the area, noting that storage facilities on this site would not provide  sustainable employment and that appropriate employment lands create  secondary employment opportunities including restaurants and service  facilities. Mrs. Nijhawan stated that the storage facility would remove the  vibrancy of the area, noting that it would create a dead zone with people  accessing and exiting the storage facilities, that it would create  additional traffic in a residential neighbourhood, but that it would not  provide any ancillary employment opportunities to generate revenue for  the community. She raised concerns about the storage facility's control  over the storage of dangerous and hazardous chemicals and illegal  Page 2 of 8  Public Meetings Minutes   May 31, 2021 - 7:00 PM    products, noting that it could present a security risk for the surrounding  neighbourhoods. Mrs. Nijhawan raised further concerns that the storage  facilities could pose a risk to attendees at the future school planned in  the area, that the value of surrounding properties may be negatively  impacted, and that the approval of this application would provide the  potential for other landowners to seek amendments that would change  the character of the community. She advised that the storage facilities  would be better suited to areas zoned industrial and located out of  residential communities.  There were no further submissions from the public.      3.

Ms. Li stated that  she would not have purchased her property had she been aware of a  future high density building located in front of her property, noting that  residents were now faced with a rezoning proposal for the development  of a 9-storey building comprised of 285 units in a small area. Ms. Li  stated that the neighbourhood was small with a lot of back-to-back  townhouses that do not have back yards or basements, noting that  children play on the driveways. She raised concerns about the additional  traffic from the proposed development, noting that it would result in  traffic gridlock and safety concerns, and frustration for road users  including pedestrians and cyclists. Ms. Li raised further concerns about  noise and environmental pollution that would result from the construction  of such a large complex, and the impact that the proposed development  would have on the value of properties in the area.

He  advised that the neighbourhood was beautiful and that he expected to  continue to have the view that he has currently. He advised that the area  was heavily tenanted and that many tenants were considering relocating  should the proposed development be approved. He raised concerns  about noise, dust, and construction equipment during construction of the  9-storey building and the impact of the project on residents that  purchased their homes 4 years ago.   There were no further submissions from the public.  Adam Fineman, Joe Nanos, Kara Green, Kate Cooper, Paul Icke,  Stephen Bahadoor, and Mike Mestyan answered questions regarding:  \u2022 mitigation of traffic safety concerns and preventing gridlock;  \u2022 concerns about the proposed development casting shadows on  neighbouring properties; and,  \u2022 mitigation of roof-top equipment noise.

She advised that since residents of  Camber Court met with representatives of Geranium Corporation on  May 18, 2021 and voiced their concerns there has been collaboration  between representatives of the neighbours and Geranium Corporation.  Mr. Chiang noted that Geranium Corporation agreed to a tree buffer and  a fence between the existing houses and the proposed development,  and that they have made alterations to the original plan by replacing  street townhouses with single family dwellings adjacent to Camber  Court. Ms. Chiang stated that there were gaps in the Brooklin  Secondary Plan leaving room for interpretation. She advised that  Camber Court was a mature low density neighbourhood consisting of  single family dwellings. She noted that the proposed development would  have single family homes transitioning to three-storey street townhouses  and then transitioning to four-storey stacked townhouses at the corner of  Camber Court and Columbus Road directly across from the existing  houses. Ms. Chiang advised that she appreciated the objective for  medium density housing along arterial roads to support future transit  and active transportation. She raised concerns about having a smooth  transition between housing density zones. She stated that the abrupt  change in height from Camber Court and the new development would  be exacerbated by the grading which would mean that the height of the  proposed four-storey stacked townhouses would be another 5 to 10 feet  higher. Ms. Chiang noted that the density in the area would range from  one of the lowest densities to one of the highest densities in Brooklin.  She stated that the Brooklin Secondary Plan was to protect the  character of existing mature neighbourhoods, provide appropriate  transition between new development and existing development in  mature residential neighbourhoods, and provide a transition in height  and density for medium density residential development adjacent to low  density residential designations. Ms. Chiang stated that the proposed  transition was described as appropriate, gentle and compatible, noting  that this description did not apply to the transitioning of density and  height along one-third of Camber Court. She requested assurances that  Geranium Corporation would develop an appropriate and gentle  transition between the existing houses and the new development that  would be comfortable and compatible with the existing neighbourhood of  Camber Court. Ms. Chiang stated that the proposed development would  occur in the context of road widening of Columbus Road which would  become an arterial road with multi-use paths. She inquired how the road  widening and the proposed development would be coordinated to  minimize impact on the neighbourhood.  Sean Hertel representing Camber Court Owners Association, 4-190  Brickworks Lane, Toronto, stated that he was retained by the Camber  Court Owners Association, which consisted of 17 homeowners, to  Page 6 of 8  Public Meetings Minutes   May 31, 2021 - 7:00 PM    provide planning advice and support throughout the approval process.  Mr. Hertel referenced his correspondence submitted to the Town dated  May 31, 2021. He advised that the Association has no objections in  principle to the proposed development, and that the Camber Court  residents expected that the site would be developed in the future. Mr.  Hertel raised concerns about design and implementation, including a  well vegetated buffer and fence along the east side of Camber Court,  the built form transitional relationship between the northern most  stacked townhouse block and Camber Court particularly for the homes  located immediately across the street. He raised further concerns about  the size and design of the active transportation connection proposed for  Camber Court. Mr. Hertel stated that there were concerns about the  adequacy of on site parking and the potential for overflow parking on  Camber Court, the design and built form quality including compatibility  with the current built form on Camber Court, and the monitoring,  phasing, and staging details of the proposed development including  mitigation of dust, noise, and vibration. Mr. Hertel advised that on site  meetings have occurred to address ways to build a sensitive interface  including fencing and natural tree lines to have a good transition and to  mimic the natural landscape that Camber Court residents have become  accustomed to. Mr. Hertel advised that representatives of Geranium  Corporation have been responsive in providing information and  renderings following meetings, and that the Camber Court Owners  Association was reviewing the latest plans.  Steve Harvey, representing the owner of 7030 Baldwin Street North  advised that due to the proposed development being located at the  intersection of Baldwin Street and Columbus Road he wanted to ensure  that the future application for development on their site would not be  negatively affected by decisions made on the proposed development.  He noted the size of the ground floor area of the 12-storey building and  the total commercial area on the ground floor and inquired whether it  would fulfill the vision of a mixed-use site at the intersection. Mr. Harvey  advised that Street B of the proposed development would not align with  their proposed development entrance which would be slightly west of  the existing concrete plant entrance off Columbus Road. He noted that  due to the size of the site at the intersection they would be restricted on  the location of entrances on their site. He advised that they would  require full turning movements, and inquired whether the proposed  Street B could be aligned with their proposed entrance. Mr. Harvey  inquired about the lowest and highest height range within the Block Plan  that would be acceptable at the intersection of Columbus Road and  Baldwin Street. He raised concerns about potable water pressures and  sanitary sewer capacities and requested confirmation from the Town  and the Region of Durham that their site would still have available  potable water pressure and sanitary sewer capacities on completion of  Page 7 of 8  Public Meetings Minutes   May 31, 2021 - 7:00 PM    the proposed development. Mr. Harvey stated that he wanted to ensure  that their storm water outlet was always kept open, noting that the  proponent was proposing to close the outlet into their site and redirect  the storm water westerly on Columbus Road. He requested confirmation  about where the storm water would be redirected to, and assurances  that it would not drain onto their site. Mr. Harvey inquired about when  Columbus Road West would be urbanized, when the ownership of  Baldwin Street would be transferred from the Ministry of Transportation  to the Region of Durham, and the requirements for sight triangles at the  intersection of Baldwin Street and Columbus Road. He further inquired  about the proposed building at the intersection and the number of  parking spaces proposed for underground and surface parking at it  relates to the commercial space proposed on the first floor. Mr. Harvey  advised that they did not have any issues with the proposed  development, but requested that answers to their questions be provided  prior to the consideration of approval of the recommendation report.  There were no further submissions from the public.  Matthew Cory, Cheryl Shindruk, Mark Schollen, Carolyn Glass, John  Priamo, Mark Jamieson, and Steve Keenan answered questions  regarding:  \u2022 the concerns raised about the height and grading of the stacked  townhouses;  \u2022 water drainage from the proposed development;  \u2022 the supply of parking and the potential for overflow parking on  Camber Court; and,  \u2022 mitigation measures regarding noise, dust and vibration during  construction.

In Support of Application   Sarah Paterson (Owner)  Stuart Paterson (Owner)  In Opposition of Application   None  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  S.

The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  J. Cardwell asked the applicant if the second storey addition                  will encroach past       the  existing building footprint.      S. Patterson confirmed that the second storey         addition will not     extend past     the current  building footprint, and       will only project vertically.        The Chair asked J.

McCarten expressed that she         understands that the     variances are     required to      recognize existing conditions for the current           dwelling; however, she would     like  confirmation that there       will be no tree cutting,           and that the     existing footprint     of the     one  storey home will not be expanded.            S. Paterson stated that the footprint           of their existing       home will not     be expanded, and       the  increase to the     maximum permitted     coverage from 10%     to 15%     is to accommodate       a  future shed/accessory     structure on the property         if desired. S. Paterson also     confirmed  that no     tree removals are proposed.        D. McCarten asked what       size of shed will be permitted           on the     property.  J. Taylor replied that       the applicants cannot       construct a shed     greater than     10 square      metres without a building permit and successful minor                variance application.

McCarten that she       will be     happy to     share their     proposed  drawings, and confirmed that the construction of             the second     storey addition will require      approximately 10 weeks to complete.

Carried on a Two Thirds Vote    4.2  Michael Dominguez, Resident  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 71-21  Envision Durham: Land Needs Assessment Technical Reports     Refer to Item 6.1, PL 71-21  Michael Dominguez appeared before Council and indicated that the  Region's population would continue to grow due to proximity to Toronto.  He indicated his support for the proposed conversion to allow for mixed- use development west of Montecourt Street. He advised that rising  home prices in the Region may reduce growth and that a lack of housing  supply was influencing prices. He noted that many zoning by-laws were  developed fifty or more years ago and do not allow for a sufficient  Page 5 of 31  Regular Council Minutes   November 29, 2021 - 7:00 PM    balance of housing types, which is now a necessity to address housing  affordability. He concluded by stating that the Town needs to be  intelligent about allowing for growth, noting that the lands west of  Montecourt Street are ideal for increased density due to their proximity  to Highway 401 and the Whitby GO Station.   A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Council and Mr. Dominguez regarding the increase in rental prices  during the pandemic and the importance of increasing density to  respond to the demand for housing supply.       4.3  Wenda D. Abel, Resident  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 71-21  Envision Durham: Land Needs Assessment Technical Reports     Refer to Item 6.1, PL 71-21  Wenda D. Abel appeared before Council and indicated that the proposal  for the development of the lands west of Montecourt Street is vague.  She noted that it is difficult to fully understand what the developer is  proposing for the lands. She stated that there has been rapid growth in  the Port Whitby area which has led to concerns about traffic and vehicle  emissions. She concluded by expressing concern about the potential  impact of development on the nearby Lynde Shores Conservation Area.   A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Council and Ms. Abel regarding the benefits to living in the Port Whitby  area, access to natural spaces, and balancing the environmental  sensitivity of the area with ongoing development in the Major Transit  Station Area.      4.4  Laura Volpe, Resident  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 71-21  Envision Durham: Land Needs Assessment Technical Reports     Refer to Item 6.1, PL 71-21  Laura Volpe appeared before Council and indicated that she has lived in  Whitby since 1990 and welcomes the proposed development for the  lands west of Montecourt Street. She noted that she would like the  opportunity to downsize from her current home in the area to a  condominium adjacent to mixed-use development and nearby  amenities.   Page 6 of 31  Regular Council Minutes   November 29, 2021 - 7:00 PM    A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Council and Ms. Volpe about the importance of providing affordable  housing in the Town.     5.

New and Unfinished Business - Planning and Development    Page 8 of 22  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 19, 2022 - 7:00 PM    Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Shahid    That a motion to introduce a matter pertaining to speed reduction be  allowed due to its timely and urgent nature.    Carried on a Two-Thirds Vote    5.1  Speed Reduction   Councillor Lee introduced a motion regarding speed reduction on all  residential streets.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Staff regarding:  \u2022 engaging a consultant prior to a report back to Council;  \u2022 Staff's perspective about the details of the proposed motion;  \u2022 whether the Connect Whitby platform would be used for  consultation with the public;  \u2022 whether 40 km/hour signs were being installed on the new  residential streets in West Whitby and Brooklin;  \u2022 amending the proposed motion to include the cost for engaging a  consultant;   \u2022 differentiating the speed for school zones and community safety  zones; and,  \u2022 referring the matter of speed reduction to the next Council  meeting.       Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Lee    Whereas, on May 30, 2017, the Province of Ontario amended the  Highway Traffic Act in respect to speed limit setting in municipalities.  This legislative change allows municipalities to designate areas through  by-laws and prescribe a speed limit that is lower than 50 km/h which will  apply to all highways within the designated area. With this approach the  Town of Whitby is no longer required to sign every individual street  within that designated area but only the entry and exit points to/from the  designated area where speed limits change and any internal roads with  a different speed limit; and,      Page 9 of 22  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 19, 2022 - 7:00 PM    Whereas the City of Toronto Council adopted a reduction in speed limits  from within certain areas as part of its vision zero plan for traffic calming  and speeding; and,    Whereas municipalities such as Hamilton, Ottawa, and London, and  King have also done similar reductions with their vision zero, traffic  calming, and road safety plans; and,    Whereas many other municipalities in the process of developing  programs to do the same; and,    Whereas residents have been asking repeatedly for safer streets, traffic  calming, and speed reductions on their streets; and,    Whereas Council has been very supportive and unanimous in its  previous traffic calming motion including speed bumps; and,    Now therefore it be resolved:    That as part of Vision Zero and the Town's traffic calming strategy, that  Staff enlist a consultant and report back on the costs of engaging a  consultant, and subject to Council approval on engaging a consultant,  Staff and the consultant would report back with an options report to  Council in Q3 2023, for the reduction of all residential streets to be  lowered from 50km to 40km per hour. The report is to include any  budgetary costs, additional staff resources, project timelines, and  consultation with the public to complete the new signage installations  and reduction in speeds.    The disposition of this matter, Item 5.1, was determined through  the referral motion below.    Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Lee    That the consideration of Item 5.1, Speed Reduction, be referred to the  Council meeting on September 26, 2022.    Carried    5.2  New and Unfinished Business - Planning and Development  Page 10 of 22  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 19, 2022 - 7:00 PM    There was no discussion regarding the New and Unfinished Business  List.

Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Shahid    1. That Report CAO 23-22 be received for information;  2. That Council endorse the Concierge Program Framework as  presented in Report CAO 23-22; and,  3. That Staff be directed to prepare a final Concierge Program to be  presented in December 2022.

A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Staff regarding:  \u2022 whether the Amber Alert was exclusively for children who were  abducted, and whether an Amber Alert should have been sent  out when Draven Graham went missing; and,  \u2022 whether there were any other emergency services available in  this type of instance apart from calling 911.      Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Leahy    Whereas we have all become aware of the recent tragic death of Draven  Graham, an 11-year-old child on the autistic spectrum, after walking  away from the family home; and,    Whereas the Amber Alert has been very effective in announcing to the  public children who have been abducted; and,    Whereas a similar alert program for those who have special needs who  leave family custody would be seem to be warranted in the Province of  Ontario.    Now therefore be it resolved:     Page 17 of 22  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 19, 2022 - 7:00 PM    1. That the Town of Whitby request the Province of Ontario to  develop and implement a community warning program similar to  Amber Alert for those persons of special needs or circumstance  who leave the care givers or locations and potentially themselves  at risk; and,  2.

Discussion ensued between Members of Committee regarding:  \u2022 the number of constituents in an electoral district;  \u2022 the determination of electoral districts based on the current  population base and the need for further review in the future;  \u2022 the federal electoral districts review after each 10-year census  and the impact of the future growth over 10 years;  \u2022 the lack of a connection between Whitby and Pickering  \u2022 the importance/influence of Council's position on behalf of the  community.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Staff regarding:  \u2022 whether Staff would be attending and/or delegating at the Federal  Electoral Boundaries Commission for Ontario Public Hearing  taking place on September 26, 2022;  \u2022 drafting a summary of Council's position via correspondence and  Council's review of the correspondence prior to providing it to the  Page 18 of 22  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 19, 2022 - 7:00 PM    Federal Electoral Districts Redistribution Commission for Ontario;  and,  \u2022 the projections for growth in Brooklin and whether growth  projections for Whitby were provided to the Federal Electoral  District Redistribution Commission for Ontario.       Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Mulcahy    Whereas the Federal Riding Review is indicating a preferred riding  allocation that the north portion of Whitby (Brooklin area) be included in  the Pickering riding;    And Whereas Brooklin, Ashburn, Myrtle, and Myrtle Station along with  the rural areas of Whitby included do not identify as similar to Pickering;    And Whereas the growth anticipated in the very near future in both  Pickering and Brooklin is known to be substantial and will require near  future riding boundary shifts once again.    Now therefore it be resolved:     1. That the Council at the Town of Whitby does not support the  proposed boundary alignment put forth by the federal review;  and,  2. That the Council of the Town of Whitby suggests a historical view  in looking at north Oshawa as part of the north Whitby alignment.    Carried later in the meeting (See following motion).    Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Shahid    That the main motion be amended by including Item 3 as follows:  3. That Staff summarize Council's strong opposition on the matter  and send the draft correspondence for Council's review prior to  providing to the Federal Electoral Districts Redistribution  Commission for Ontario.    Carried    Page 19 of 22  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 19, 2022 - 7:00 PM    The main motion, as amended, was then carried as follows:    Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Mulcahy    Whereas the Federal Riding Review is indicating a preferred riding  allocation that the north portion of Whitby (Brooklin area) be included in  the Pickering riding;    And Whereas Brooklin, Ashburn, Myrtle, and Myrtle Station along with  the rural areas of Whitby included do not identify as similar to Pickering;    And Whereas the growth anticipated in the very near future in both  Pickering and Brooklin is known to be substantial and will require near  future riding boundary shifts once again.

A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Staff regarding:  \u2022 the status of the previously approved entrance and exit ramps at  Rossland Road on Highway 412;   \u2022 safety issues associated with the lack of signalization lights at the  intersections of the on and off ramps to provincial Highways 2  and 7, and the rationale for the lights not being installed; and,  \u2022 whether the signalization of the on/exit ramps could be  incorporated into the project for the expansion of Dundas Street  from Lake Ridge Road to Fothergill Court.      Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Mulcahy    Whereas the traffic has increased in volume on Highway 412 since the  tolls were lifted earlier this year; and,    Whereas residents report that the intersections of the on and off ramps  at both Highway 7 and Highway 2 are difficult to navigate safely; and,    Whereas there is substantial growth around the Rossland Road area of  Highway 412; and,    Whereas the east-west roads within our municipality are increasingly  congested with all the new growth, and the usage of Highway 412 is  anticipated to increase substantially.    Now therefore be it resolved:     1. That the Council of the Town of Whitby requests that the  Province of Ontario install entrance and exit ramps at Rossland  Road on Highway 412, as well as provide for signalization lights  at the intersections of the on and off ramps to provincial highways  2 and 7; and,  2.

O'Carroll asked if the area to be removed along the south portion of the driveway will  be added to the north side of the driveway.    Minutes of the 15th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  J. Malfara replied yes. He noted that this is required in order for the driveway to be 5.5m  in width.   The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that letters of objection were received and were  forwarded to the Committee in advance of the meeting.   The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.   A. Lindsay introduced herself to the Committee as the original owner of the applicants  dwelling. She noted that prior to her ownership of the property, the driveway was  illegally widened to sit flush with the south lot line. She asked why the Town is asking  the applicant to create a 0.6m setback/landscape buffer to the south lot line.   The Chair advised A. Lindsay that the current By-law requires that a driveway shall be  setback a minimum of 0.6m from an interior lot line within a front yard.   A. Lindsay noted that this property has the smallest frontage in the neighbourhood and  that this home was constructed as single family dwelling, and permitting rental units will  change the character of the neighbourhood.  The Chair noted that the accessory apartment is permitted and Provincial legislation  supports accessory apartments within ground oriented dwellings.   A. Lindsay asked why the driveway can not stay the same without creating the  landscape strip along the south side of the property.   J. Malfara stated that a driveway shall be setback a minimum of 0.6m from an interior lot  line within a front yard, and in this scenario the driveway will require a minimum width of  5.5m to accommodate two legal parking spaces side by side.  The Chair noted that notwithstanding the variances, the applicant will also be required  to obtain a successful building permit for the proposed apartment dwelling.   B. O'Carroll asked how many bedrooms will be located in the apartment unit.   R. Gajula replied one bedroom.   The Chair asked if the basement is currently operating as an accessory apartment.   R. Gajula replied no.    J. Cardwell asked the applicant if they have spoken with the Building Department about  the permitting process.   R. Gajula replied yes, and a permit will be filed following the minor variance process.    Minutes of the 15th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  The Chair asked if there were any other members of the public wishing to speak to the  application.   P. Bingham introduced himself to the Committee as the owner of 39 Glenmore Drive.  He asked if the applicant will be residing in the dwelling.   R. Gajula replied that he will be living in the dwelling.  P. Bingham asked why an apartment is permitted in a single family dwelling.   J. Malfara clarified that this property is zoned for a detached dwelling and the single  family verbiage does not necessarily mean only one family can be living within the  dwelling. J. Malfara noted that the Province has provided directives that encourage  accessory apartment dwelling units within all ground oriented dwellings and the Towns  By-law reflects this by allowing accessory apartments currently within single detached  dwellings and semi-detached dwellings.  P. Bingham questions if these types of properties are the most suitable for accessory  apartments versus properties with dwellings containing two car garages and larger  driveway.   The Chair asked if there were any other members of the public wishing to speak to the  application.   V. Guerreiro introduced himself to the Committee as the owner of the neighbouring  property to the south. He advised the Committee that he understands the Provincial  policy directives.   V. Guerreiro noted that R. Gajula is welcomed addition to the neighbourhood, but has  some concerns with the proposed accessory apartment use.   V. Guerreiro noted that the proposed driveway reconfiguration to create a 0.6m setback  to the south lot line is appropriate, but expressed concern with regards to the  preservation of the existing street tree located on the north side of the driveway within  the Town's boulevard.   V. Guerreiro further expressed concerns with regards to waste collection, the potential  for additional on-street parking, as well as noise and light impacts that may result from  future tenants entering the accessory apartment through a proposed side yard entry.   Related to the proposed access door into the accessory apartment, V. Guerre noted  that the distance separating his dwelling and the applicant's dwelling is minimal.   J. Malfara noted that the Zoning By-law does not include lighting provisions, but noted  that it is good practice to only install down-lit lighting fixtures, and with regards to the  proposed side yard entry, this is permitted as of right by the Zoning By-law based on the  existing side yard setbacks of the applicant's dwelling.   The Chair asked if there were any other members of the public wishing to speak to the  application. There was no one.    Minutes of the 15th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Moved by: J. Cardwell  That the application to (1) reduce the minimum lot frontage for a semi-detached dwelling  containing an accessory apartment from 10.0m to 9.1m; and (2) reduce the minimum  required front yard landscaped coverage from 40% to 38% located at 49 Glenmore  Drive be Granted subject to the following condition:  1. That a 0.6m setback be provided between the driveway and south lot line.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variances are  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.     Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/89/21  YEJ Studio and Consulting  68 Summerside Ave  An application has been received from YEJ Studio and Consulting for variances from  the provisions of By-Law 1784.  The application is for permission to: (1) reduce the minimum number of parking spaces  dedicated to an accessory apartment dwelling unit from 1 to 0; and (2) permit an  accessory apartment within a link dwelling having a minimum lot frontage of 9.0m.  The subject property is located at 68 Summerside Avenue and is zoned Residential  (R3A*) within the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  In Support of Application  Hassan Robah (Applicant)   In Opposition of Application  None at this time.  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  H. Robah introduced himself to the Committee and provided an overview of the  requested variance. He advised the Committee that he reviewed the Staff Report and  agreed with the recommendation to table the application to a future meeting, which  would allow them to address the comments provided by the Engineering Services  Department.   The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.   S. Haslam noted that the Committee historically has not supported private parking on  the Town's boulevards.   J. Malfara noted that this has been the case, and this typically stemmed from comments  provided by the Engineering Services Department as this is the department that  regulates uses and activities that occur within the Town's boulevards. In this instance,  the Engineering Services Department has expressed to the applicant that they would  like to review a brief to justify the lack of parking space and how it will be addressed  before supporting or objecting to the applicant's request.   The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application. There was none.   The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.     Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Moved by: B. O'Carroll  That the application to (1) reduce the minimum number of parking spaces dedicated to  an accessory apartment dwelling unit from 1 to 0; and (2) permit an accessory  apartment within a link dwelling having a minimum lot frontage of 9.0m located at 68  Summerside Ave be Tabled to the next available Committee of Adjustment meeting  pending input from the Engineering Services Department.    Carried     Item 3:  Approval of Previous Minutes  Moved by:  B. O'Carroll  That the minutes of the Committee of Adjustment held on Thursday  October 21, 2021 be adopted.

Recommendation:    Moved By Mayor Mitchell    Whereas activities related to organized sports such as close contact,  forceful exhalation, prolonged exposure, crowded indoor spaces and  removal of masks/face coverings during physical activity enhance the  likelihood of COVID-19 transmission; and,    Whereas the current Provincial Regulations do not require participants  in organized sports ages 12 to 17 to provide proof of vaccination or  proof of medical exemption, despite this age group being eligible for  COVID-19 vaccinations; and,   Page 10 of 15  Committee of the Whole Minutes   October 18, 2021 - 7:00 PM       Whereas the current Provincial Regulations do not require proof of  vaccination or proof of medical exemption for any participant in  organized sports serving in the capacity of a volunteer, coach, or  official, including adults over the age of 18; and,     Whereas the Provincial Chief Medical Officer of Health has  encouraged individual sports organizations, such as minor hockey  associations, to develop their own policies requiring proof of  vaccination of players, coaches, trainers, referees, and other  participants; and,    Whereas the Regional Medical Officer of Health has recommend that  sports and recreational fitness facilities consider developing their own  policies requiring proof of vaccination for all participants in organized  sports ages 12 and older including players, coaches, officials, and  volunteers; and,    Whereas requiring proof of vaccination for all individuals ages 12 and  older in sports and recreational fitness facilities will strengthen  protections in the community by helping to curb the spread of COVID- 19; and,     Whereas a Provincial or Regional requirement for proof of vaccination  for all participants ages 12 and older at all sports and recreational  fitness facilities in Ontario or Durham Region would provide residents  with clarity and consistency.      Now therefore be it resolved:     1. That the Town of Whitby requests the Province of Ontario and  Region of Durham to enact regulations requiring proof of  vaccination at all sports and recreational fitness facilities for all  participants in organized sports ages 12 and older including  players coaches, officials, and volunteers at these events; and,  2. That the Clerk be directed to send a copy of this resolution to  Dr. Kieran Moore, Provincial Chief Medical Officer of Health,  Dr. Robert Kyle, Regional Medical Officer of Health, M.P.P.

Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Leahy    Whereas according to the most recent Canada census data 52% of  the population of Whitby are women; and,     Whereas the government of Ontario has taken a leadership position  and recently announced a province-wide initiative to provide free  menstrual products to every secondary school in Ontario; and,      Whereas \"Period Poverty\" where girls do not have access or the  resources for menstrual products exists in our community, and this  can interfere with their ability to take part in sports and or activities;  and,     Whereas menstrual products are a necessity, not a luxury; and,      Whereas access to free high-quality products is fundamentally a  human rights issue and crucial to the health, well being and success  of women who don't have access to these products; and,      Whereas women's menstrual products are not currently freely  available in all public Town operated facilities, and,      Whereas the lack of feminine hygiene products has been identified as  a barrier to access for some women and girls.      Therefore be it resolved:   Page 12 of 15  Committee of the Whole Minutes   October 18, 2021 - 7:00 PM       1. That staff investigate the possibility and cost of adding free  menstrual products to all public Town facilities and add this as  a decision item for the 2022 Town budget; and,  2.
