Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.   Minutes of the 1st Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/06/19  Mike Pfeiffer  37 Torian Avenue  An application has been received from Mike Pfeiffer for variances from the provisions of  the Town of Whitby Zoning By-Law 1784.  The application is for permission to:   1. increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 20% to 30%; and   2. increase the maximum permitted building height from 8.5m to 9.0m.  The requested variances are required to permit the development of a new detached  residential dwelling on the subject property. The existing dwelling is proposed to be  removed.   The subject property is located at 37 Torian Avenue and is zoned Residential 3 (R3-BP)  within the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784. (R3-BP).  In Support of Application  Mike Pfeiffer (applicant)  In Opposition of Application  None at this time.  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  M. Pfeiffer introduced himself to the Committee as the applicant and owner of the  subject property. He stated that the requested variances are required to permit the  development of a new home with a larger footprint, as well as increased height which is  required to support his desired building style.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.   S. Haslam asked the applicant if he was satisfied with the condition provided in the Staff  Report by the Public Works Department.   M. Pfeiffer replied yes, but was questioning what increase of lot coverage would  typically trigger the requirement of a stormwater management brief.   S. Haslam stated that when a new building is proposed, the current Town engineering  standards need to be complied with.   J. Taylor stated that in the 1960's stormwater infrastructure in this neighbourhood was  designed based on maximum lot coverages of 20%. When lot coverages exceed the  20% a stormwater management brief is typically required to demonstrate that there will  be no impacts.   Minutes of the 1st Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  M. Pfeiffer asked if the Public Works condition can be amended to include verbiage  which would allow alternatives to a formal stormwater management brief if deemed  appropriate by the Public Works Department.  The Chair advised the applicant that the Committee can amend the condition if a motion  is brought forward and carried.   B. O'Carroll advised the applicant that the Building Division stated that a home based  business is not permitted within the dwelling if an accessory apartment is proposed. She  asked if a condition can be included to preclude a home based business within the  dwelling if the applicant moves forward with his proposal for the basement apartment.   J. Taylor replied that the Zoning By-law already regulates this matter.    The Chair asked J.

The Chair noted that the Town of Whitby does have overnight parking restrictions.  S. Haslam noted that parking cash-in-lieu has been accepted by the Town. He asked  staff if this was considered for this project.  J. Malfara noted that cash-in-lieu for parking is only applicable within Downtown Whitby  and this project is outside of the Downtown zone.  D. Mercier provided an overview of Variance #10. She noted that this variance is  required as a result of a slight vertical projection of the below grade parking structure  and its proximity to the north property line.  Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment                       The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  J. Cardwell asked if the area above the parking structure will be used for amenity  spaces.  D. Mercier replied yes.  D. Mercier provided an overview of Variance #11.

Cardwell asked staff if the Fire Department has reviewed and approved the internal  driveway configuration.  J. Malfara replied that he will defer this question to K. Kram.  K. Kram noted that the Fire Department has reviewed the Site Plan and have no  concerns.  D. Mercier provided an overview of Variance #12. She noted that the loading area  driveway width serving Building A is 5.0m and Building C/D/E is 6.0m. The 7.0m  minimum requirement can not be met due to site size constraints, and that extra room  for pedestrian access and amenity was desired.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee. There were none.  D. Mercier provided an overview of Variance #13. She noted that each of the loading  spaces are within proximity to each of the buildings at grade.  The Chair noted that he was only able to see 4 of the proposed loading spaces.  J. Malfara provided clarification on the location of the loading spaces.  The Chair noted that all of the requested variances have been described by the  applicant. He asked D.

She further noted that the variances are appropriate and meet the four tests.  The Chair asked if there were any further questions from the Committee.  J. Cardwell asked who will control access to the ten proposed parking spaces on the  surface.  D. Mercier replied that this will be the responsibility of the condominium board and on  site concierge.  S. Haslam asked the applicant how the variances are desirable for the neighborhood.  Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment           D. Mercier expressed that the site is underdeveloped and vacant, and the proposal  represents an appropriate form of intensification, in line with the Town of Whitby Official  Plan. The proposal will enhance the streetscape along Charles Street and the height  and massing of the structures have been done in a way to respect the surrounding land  uses.  D. Mercier noted that the Zoning permits two 18-storey towers, however only one is  proposed. She further noted that the proposal would not result in any adverse impacts  on the surrounding lands and meets the general intent of the Zoning By-law.  B. O'Carroll asked if there will be a sidewalk along the Charles Street frontage.  D. Mercier replied yes.  B. O'Carroll asked if landscaping is proposed along Charles Street.  D. Mercier replied yes.  B. O'Carroll asked if a fence is proposed along the Charles Street frontage.  D. Mercier replied no, but a fence is proposed along the north property line.  The Chair asked J. Malfara is any public correspondence was received.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that all written correspondence was circulated prior to  this meeting, and there are a number of participants in the audience for this application.  J. Malfara noted that anyone from the public who wishes to speak to this application  should state their full name, address, and if they support or object to the application.  D. Coombes introduced himself to the Committee as a resident and President of the  condominium board for 1600 Charles Street. He advised the Committee that this  proposal will have an adverse impact to residents of 1600 Charles Street with respect to  the obstruction of views of Lake Ontario and the Whitby Marina.  D. Mercier advised the Committee that the Zoning for the property, permitting two 18  storey apartment buildings was approved in 2010.  The Chair asked Planning staff to confirm.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that this is correct. A site specific zoning was passed  in 2010 permitting two 18 storey buildings on the property.  D. Jones introduced herself to the Committee as the owner of 1705 Charles Street. She  expressed concerns with the reduction to the parking requirement. She noted that this  area within the Town has a parking issue and there is often an influx of residents  continually parking on Charles Street.  D. Norton introduced himself as the owner of 37 Bedell Crescent. He noted that he has  similar concerns regarding parking as D. Jones and is in objection to the requested  Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment       variances. D. Norton expressed that the parking reduction is excessive and the trend  today is for families to have more than one vehicle. The 10 visitor parking spaces is also  not sufficient.  D. Mercier replied that there is a total of 53 visitor parking spaces, 10 of which are at  grade.  D. Norton asked if visitors will be required to pass through security to enter the below  grade spaces.  D. Mercier replied that this will be determined by the condominium corporation.  D. Norton concluded that his main objection relates to the parking variances, and he  has no other objections to the other variances.  W. Cross introduced himself as the owner of 1600 Charles Street. He expressed  concerns with the parking variances. He also noted that people within the community  are currently parking in their visitor parking spaces, who are not visiting residents within  their building. Further, he expressed concern with additional parking impacts along  Charles Street when other developments nearby are constructed.  L. O'Grady introduced herself to the Committee as a resident of 360 Watson Street and  expressed concerns with the reduction to the parking rate.  M. Lapp introduced himself as a resident of 360 Watson Street. He asked the  Committee if municipal garbage collection vehicles can maneuver the site based on the  driveway widths.  D. Mercier noted that a swept path analysis was prepared and accepted by the Town,  confirming truck movements within the site.  M. Lapp asked if waste collection will be private of public.  D. Mercier replied private collection.  J. Malfara confirmed that this site will be subject to private waste collection.  M. Lapp noted that if the site is services by private collection, the Town has no control  over how the waste is processed.  J. Taylor stated that waste collection for wet garbage, standard waste and recycling is  required within each of the buildings.  M. Lapp asked if residents of these condominiums would be permitted a tax break since  they have paid for private waste collection through their condominium fees.  J. Malfara replied that no tax reductions or credits would be issued.  S. Narendiran introduced herself as a resident of 1600 Charles Street. She expressed  concerns with the parking reduction as well as a lack of parking for current residents  Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment                                                                         already in the area. She noted that people would be forced to park at the GO Station  parking lot which is not desirable.  A motion was brought forward by J. Cardwell to APPROVE the requested variances  subject to the conditions included within the Planning Staff Report.  The motion was defeated.  A motion was brought forward by S. Haslam that:  That the application to:  1.  reduce the minimum required front yard setback and east setback on Appendix A  from 4.5m to 4.0m;  2.  reduce the minimum required additional front yard setback for any building  elevation greater than 4 storeys in height from 3.0m to 2.0m;  3.  permit balconies, porches and patios to project a maximum of 3.35m beyond the  minimum building setback lines on Appendix A and allow them to project a  maximum of 3.35m into the minimum required front and rear yard setbacks;  4.  permit covered entrances and other similar ornamental structures to project a  maximum of 2.95m beyond the minimum building setback lines on Appendix A  and allow them to project a maximum of 2.95m into the minimum required front  and rear yard setbacks;  5.  permit balconies, patios, porches, canopies/covered entrances, and other similar  ornamental structures to project a maximum of 2.8m into the minimum required  distance between apartment buildings;  6.  increase the maximum permitted rear yard setback to a portion of Building F from  6m to 8.7m;  7.  vary the definition of \"storey\" to increase the maximum permitted height of a  storey from 3.5m to 4.95m for the first two storeys of Building A;  8.  reduce the minimum required number of parking spaces for residents from 1.25  spaces per unit to 1.12 spaces per unit;  9.  reduce the minimum required number of visitors parking spaces from 0.25  spaces per unit to 0.15 spaces per unit;  10.  reduce the minimum required interior side yard setback (north) for a parking  structure projecting less than 1.2m above finished grade from 1.0m to 0.5m;  11.  increase the maximum permitted width of a two-way driveway from 9.0m to  10.0m;  Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment                     12.  reduce the minimum required width of a two-way driveway serving a loading area  from 7.0m to 5.0m (Building A) and 6.0m (Buildings C, D and E); and  13.  reduce the minimum required number of loading spaces from 6 to 5.located at  1606 Charles Street be Refused.

The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  B. O'Carroll asked the applicant how he was made aware of the required variances.  L. Nolet replied that a Town of Whitby Building Inspector advised him that some of the  structures on the property did not have building permits and variances would also be  required.   Minutes of the 4th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  B. O'Carroll asked if building permits were issued in the past for any of the structures.  J. Taylor replied no, but, the applicant has now applied for building permits for the  recently constructed accessory structures.  D.

The Chair asked if there were any further questions from the Committee. There were  none.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that no correspondence was received.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.  Moved by: J.

Minutes of the 4th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/23/19, A/27/19, A/28/19, A/29/19, A/30/19  Miller Planning Services on behalf of 1608316 Ontario Inc.  780 Garden Street  An application has been received from Miller Planning Services on behalf of 1608316  Ontario Inc. for variances from the provisions of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-Law  2585.  The application is for permission to: (1) increase the maximum permitted lot coverage  from 33% to 45%; (2) reduce the minimum exterior side yard setback from 4.5m to  3.0m; and (3) increase the maximum permitted building height from 8.0m to 9.5m.  The subject property is located at 780 Garden Street and is zoned Single Detached  Dwelling House (R2A) within the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 2585.  In Support of Application  Rodger Miller (Planner)  Kevin Lauzon (Owner)  In Opposition of Application  R. Zawislak  N. Schroeder  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  R. Miller introduced himself to the Committee as the planning consultant retained by the  owner of the subject property. He noted that he was satisfied and agreed with the  conclusions of the planning staff report.  R. Miller noted that variance No. 2 only applies to lot 1 as illustrated on the Site Plan.  He stated that the requested reduction to the exterior side yard setback is appropriate  and will maintain a suitable buffer to Garden Street.  R. Miller noted that variance No. 1 is required to increase the maximum permitted lot  coverage. He stated that the increased lot coverage is required due to the proposed  dwelling type (bungaloft). This building typology requires a larger ground floor footprint  since the loft (second storey) does not have much living space. He further noted that the  proposed dwelling will occupy approximately 43% of the lot area and an additional 2%  of lot coverage is being requested to permit a future accessory structure (shed) on the  property.  R. Miller expressed that variance No. 3 is required to permit an increased building  height. He stated that the building height provision permitted by the Zoning by-law is an  outdated standard and does not reflect new building styles. The building height will be  approximately 9.0m, whereas an additional 0.5m is requested as a buffer to  accommodate any grading constraints when the dwellings are constructed.   Minutes of the 4th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  J. Cardwell asked the applicant what the floor to ceiling heights will be.  R. Miller replied that the first floor will have 10 foot ceiling heights, and the second floor  will have 9 foot ceiling heights.  The Chair asked the applicant if the Land Division application to create the five lots was  approved.  R. Miller replied yes.  B. O'Carroll asked the applicant if the loft component of the dwelling will be facing the  rear yard or the front yard.  R. Miller replied that the loft will be facing the front yard.  K. Lauzon noted that the homes will be constructed as \"net zero\" dwellings. The roof  configuration has been designed to accommodate approximately 48 solar panels that  will be used to help power the home.  D. McCarroll asked what the proposed dwellings will look like from the north side of  Waywell Street.  K. Lauzon replied that three of the five proposed dwellings will face the exterior yard of  a dwelling flanking Waywell Street (49 Limestone Cres). He also noted that the  dwellings on the north side of Waywell Street are situated at a higher elevation. The  proposed dwellings on the south side will only have a 2% increasing slope from  Waywell Street and will therefore appear at a lower height than the existing dwellings on  the north side of Waywell Street.  The Chair asked if there were any other questions from the Committee. There were  none.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that no correspondence was received.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.  R. Zawislak introduced himself to the Committee as the resident of 62 Waywell Street.  He and his wife were concerned about the loss of views resulting from the applicants  proposed dwellings. He asked if the proposed roof design will be similar to other  dwellings in the neighbourhood.  J. Taylor advised that the proposed roof will be a different style.   Minutes of the 4th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  R. Zawislak noted that his main concern is with the requested building height. He asked  why the applicant can't reduce the proposed ceiling heights to 8 feet.  The Chair noted that 8 foot ceiling heights are an old standard.  K. Lauzon expressed that the front doors of the proposed dwellings will be level with the  street elevation. He produced a 3D rendering of one of the proposed dwellings and  circulated it to the Committee and R. Zawislak for viewing.  J. Cardwell asked if the roof will be flat.  K. Lauzon replied that the roof will have a shallow slope.  The Chair asked if the loft will be the tallest part of the structure.  R. Miller replied yes, and also expressed that the loft portion of the dwelling will be  setback (south) from the front face of the first storey.  R. Zawislak asked if he can obtain more information about the elevations for the  proposed dwelling.  J. Taylor replied that he can possibly meet with the applicant to view any other materials  that they may have available.  R. Miller provided R. Zawislak his business card and noted that they will meet to review  the elevations and building height in greater detail.   The Chair asked if there was anyone else from the public who wished to speak to this  application.  N. Schroeder introduced herself to the Committee as the owner of 44 Waywell Street.  She was concerned about the setbacks between the proposed dwellings, as well as the  requested increased lot coverage as it relates to ground water infiltration.  N. Schroeder also asked why the applicant required 9 and 10 foot ceiling heights.  The Chair replied that the proposed ceiling heights are reflective of new home  standards.  N. Schroeder stated that the setback between the dwellings may pose a fire issue and  she does not believe that the proposed dwellings will compliment the surrounding  community.  K. Lauzon replied that an efficiency study was completed for the proposed dwellings.  The homes as proposed will be approximately 60% to 70% more efficient than a similar  size standard built home.   Minutes of the 4th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Moved by: D. McCarroll  That the application to (1) increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 33% to  45%; (2) reduce the minimum exterior side yard setback from 4.5m to 3.0m; and (3)  increase the maximum permitted building height from 8.0m to 9.5m located at 780  Garden Street be Granted subject to the following conditions:  1. That the site grading and all other services conform to the requirements of the  Public Works Department;  2. That roof drainage from the proposed structure shall not be directed onto the  adjacent property; and  3. That the properties adhere to the conditions of LD 034-037/2018 land division  approvals.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variances are  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.

Peter introduced himself to the Committee as the President of the Thickson Woods  Land Trust.  The Chair asked O. Peter if he also attended the Committee of Adjustment meeting for  the subject property in 2011.  O. Peter replied no.  O.

The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.   D. McCarroll asked if the proposed single car garage meets the minimum dimensions  required by the Zoning By-law.   J. Taylor replied that the internal garage dimension (length) does not meet the  requirement of the Zoning By-law, however, the internal dimension of the garage is  sufficient in size to accommodate a parking space as identified in the by-law.  The Chair asked if there were any other questions from the Committee. There were  none.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara replied that no correspondence was received.

Mr. Barnes stated that in accordance with the  legislation, the property owner was required to replace the tree with one  of a specific size and species.   R. Schaaf and S. Jarvis, the appellants, appeared before the Committee  and requested that the Property Standards Order compliance date be  extended to June 1, 2021 due to difficulties acquiring one of the tree  varieties outlined in the Property Standards Order.

He noted that the building had been  designed in conjunction with Planning and Development Staff and that  Page 2 of 11  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 14, 2020 - 7:00 PM    residents had raised concerns regarding the amount of traffic, the speed  of vehicular traffic along Hunter Street, and parking issues generated by  the proposal.

A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee,  Mr. Pellegrino, Mr. Abott, and Mr. Cane regarding:  \u2022 whether access from Kendalwood Road was possible;  \u2022 the number of parking spaces provided and the amount of  anticipated trip traffic in and out of the parking lot;  \u2022 concerns related to the internal traffic flow through the site,  particularly at night, and whether they were working to mitigate  residents' concerns;  \u2022 implementing measures to designate the space as office and  personal service use only;  \u2022 whether measures were being taken to reduce or restrict street  parking on Hunter Street; and,  \u2022 whether alternatives had been considered to address concerns  from residents about driveway access/congestion.      2.2  Alison and Brian Jimmo  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 38-20  Zoning By-law Amendment Application, Dr. Michael Pellegrino, 121  Kendalwood Road, File: DEV-23-19 (Z-14-19)      Refer to Item 4.2, PL 38-20  Alison and Brian Jimmo, 112 Hunter Street, appeared before the  Committee and stated that the proposed Zoning By-law Amendment  would not be consistent with the Official Plan which designated the  subject land as a living area predominantly for housing purposes. Ms.  Jimmo requested that a traffic study be conducted to address residents'  concerns related to street parking, trip traffic, and traffic congestion on  Hunter Street and that parking lot exits be reconsidered. She stated that  the amendment application indicated a change in designation for the  entire block rather than the subject land. Ms. Jimmo raised concerns  regarding the storage and removal of garbage for the commercial sites.   A question and answer period ensued between Members of the  Committee and Ms. Jimmo regarding:  \u2022 the amount of traffic experienced on Hunter Street;  \u2022 reducing the number of units within the proposed development;  \u2022 whether the proponent addressed residents' concerns after the  September 30, 2019 Public Meeting; and,  Page 3 of 11  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 14, 2020 - 7:00 PM    \u2022 implementing measures to restrict hours for parking.

Ms.  Avanse stated that the existing entrance located on Myrtle Road West  would be used to access the tower. She further advised that the tower  would increase cellular coverage in the rural area and the adjacent  community to the northeast, and provided a coalition opportunity for  cellular carriers to utilize a singular tower. Ms. Avanse stated that  Shared Tower Corp. did not send out public notifications as there were  no private properties within the 195 metre notification radius.

Mr. Richard advised  that the road presented safety concerns due to a lack of lane markings,  street lights, and the blind spot at the entrance of the driveway. He  stated that the interior space of the structure was inadequate to support  the number of people using the building. Mr. Richard expressed  concerns regarding meeting fire codes, emergency vehicle access, and  whether the proposed parking spaces would accommodate the number  of vehicles anticipated. He stated that the estimate of 1.6 persons per  car would necessitate 86 parking spaces and requested that a traffic  study be completed. Mr. Richard advised that the surrounding properties  consisted of agricultural land and single-use family dwellings and  expressed concerns regarding adverse effects of this proposal on  surrounding properties.  A brief question and answer period ensued between Mr. Richard and  Members of the Committee regarding whether placing limitations on the  number of people that may visit the site at the same time would be an  acceptable solution.   It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 4.4, PL 40-20, at  this time.      2.6  Steve Edwards and Jeff Warford representing Clinic Buildings (1979)  Ltd.

The application is for permission to:  1. permit the issuance of a building permit for a proposed building addition on a lot  which does not front upon an improved public street;  2. reduce the minimum required lot frontage from 45.5m to 30.0m;  3. increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 10% to 15%;  4. reduce the minimum required front yard setback from 15.0m to 6.5m;  5. reduce the minimum required interior side yard setback from 4.5m to 4.0m;  6. reduce the minimum required rear yard setback to an accessory structure from  15.0m to 1.0m; and  7. reduce the minimum required lot area from 2,785 sq.m to 900 sq.m.  The subject property is located at 119 Corbett Ave and is zoned Agricultural (A) within  Zoning By-law 1784.  In Support of Application   Sarah Paterson (Owner)  Stuart Paterson (Owner)  In Opposition of Application   None  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  S. Paterson introduced     herself to     the Committee and advised         that the variances are  required to recognize       existing zoning     provisions (non-compliances) and       to permit     a  second storey addition       to the     existing one storey dwelling     on the     subject property.    The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  J. Cardwell asked the applicant if the second storey addition                  will encroach past       the  existing building footprint.      S. Patterson confirmed that the second storey         addition will not     extend past     the current  building footprint, and       will only project vertically.        The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that no             correspondence had been received in relation      to the subject application.    Minutes of the 4th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Chair asked if there was anyone from the                  public who     wished to speak to       the subject      application.  D. McCarten introduced     herself to the Committee as           the owner of the     neighbouring  property located at       115 Corbett Avenue. D. McCarten stated           that she and her       husband  own the lands to         the south and east of 119           Corbett Avenue.    D. McCarten expressed that she         understands that the     variances are     required to      recognize existing conditions for the current           dwelling; however, she would     like  confirmation that there       will be no tree cutting,           and that the     existing footprint     of the     one  storey home will not be expanded.            S. Paterson stated that the footprint           of their existing       home will not     be expanded, and       the  increase to the     maximum permitted     coverage from 10%     to 15%     is to accommodate       a  future shed/accessory     structure on the property         if desired. S. Paterson also     confirmed  that no     tree removals are proposed.        D. McCarten asked what       size of shed will be permitted           on the     property.  J. Taylor replied that       the applicants cannot       construct a shed     greater than     10 square      metres without a building permit and successful minor                variance application.  D. McCarten inquired about the type           and size of       windows being proposed       for the      addition.  S. Paterson replied to D.         McCarten that she       will be     happy to     share their     proposed  drawings, and confirmed that the construction of             the second     storey addition will require      approximately 10 weeks to complete.        The Chair asked if anyone else would like to speak to the subject application. There  was no one.  Moved by: D. McCarroll  That the application to permit the issuance of a building permit for a proposed building  addition on a lot which does not front upon an improved public street, (2) reduce the  minimum required lot frontage from 45.5m to 30.0m, (3) increase the maximum  permitted lot coverage from 10% to 15%, (4) reduce the minimum required front yard  setback from 15.0m to 6.5m, (5) reduce the minimum required interior side yard setback  from 4.5m to 4.0m, (6) reduce the minimum required rear yard setback to an accessory  structure from 15.0m to 1.0m; and (7) reduce the minimum required lot area from 2,785  sq.m to 900 sq.m located at 119 Corbett Avenue be GRANTED subject to the following  conditions:  1.

On July 9, 2021 the original application was considered by the Town of Whitby  Committee of Adjustment. The Committee granted the following variances in principle:  (1) to reduce the minimum required lot frontage from 21.5m to 19.0m; (2) to reduce the  minimum required front yard setback from 10.5m to 7.5m; (3) to increase the maximum  permitted building height from 8.5m to 9.0m; and (4) to reduce the minimum required lot  area from 925 sq. m to 725 sq. m.  A requested variance to increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 20% to  35% was tabled to this meeting pending the Committee's review of a siting plan for the  proposed dwelling.  The requested variances are required to permit the severance of the subject property into  two parcels, and to also permit the construction of a detached dwelling on the subject  property.

D. DeNoble introduced himself to the Committee as the applicant. He advised the  Committee that the proposed building plans for the severed and retained lots had been  revised as a result of public input received at the July 8th Committee of Adjustment  meeting. As a result of the public input received at the previous meeting, the applicant  has revised their concept plan from a bungaloft (with additional floor space on the  second floor) to a bungalow with all living space situated on the main floor. A photo of  the proposed dwellings was made available for viewing.  D. DeNoble also noted that the height of the homes have been reduced to comply with  the By-law, and therefore the requested height variances can be withdrawn.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  S. Haslam asked if the requested lot coverage accounts for just the dwelling, and if so  will any additional structures be proposed in the future (i.e. sheds).  D. DeNoble replied that the 35% applies to the dwelling and no additional structures are  proposed.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that public correspondence was received, and the  letters received were forwarded to the Committee in advance of the meeting.   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.  K. Kelly introduced himself to the Committee and noted that he was in attendance at the  July 8th meeting. He expressed his continued objection to the applicant's proposal.  B. Burke introduced himself to the Committee. He expressed concerns with the  proposed garage projections into the front yard and reduction of greenspace.  D. Wright introduced himself to the Committee and noted that he was also speaking on  behalf of Carroll Susanne Cooper (53 Meadow Cres) as well. He advised the  Committee that he owns the neighbouring property to the north of the applicant's  property. He stated that the requested lot coverage would result in a dwelling that is  much larger than the existing homes in the neighbourhood.  D. Wright also stated that the proposal would result in the applicant's garage projecting  into the front yard and would result in visual impacts observed from his property.  D. Wright asked D. DeNoble if the stairs shown on the site plan both lead to the  basement.  D. DeNoble replied yes.  D. Wright concluded that his objection to the proposal remains unaltered from the last  meeting.  M. Sigsworth introduced himself to the Committee as the owner of 63 Meadow  Crescent. He asked the Chair about the Committees mandate/criteria on how decisions  are rendered.  The Chair expressed that the Committee is bound by the policies as outline by the  Ontario Planning Act and referred to the 4 tests as outlined within the Act.  M. Sigsworth asked if the application was reviewed with regards to being minor.  The Chair advised M. Sigsworth that the Committee is here to hear the comments of the  public.  M. Sigsworth concluded that his objection to the application remains unaltered and does  not believe the variance is minor.  A. Armstrong introduced himself as the owner of 52 Meadow Crescent. He expressed  concerns regarding stormwater run-off on the property.  D. DeNoble noted that stormwater would be directed to the side yards.  J. Malfara noted that as part of the Building Permit process the Public Works  Department would be responsible for reviewing the grading of the property and  stormwater management within the site.   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  K. Kelly noted that in the past, stormwater run-off from the site has impacted his  property.  J. Cardwell asked staff what the as of right zone provisions would allow for on this  property.  J. Malfara noted that the zoning currently permits 20% lot coverage and a maximum  building height of 8.5m which would permit a 2 storey dwelling to be erected.  J. Malfara noted that an approximate 3000.0 sq.ft dwelling could be constructed on the  property while complying with the By-law.  D. Wright asked if the garage is part of the lot coverage.  J. Malfara replied yes.  D. Wright noted that there are no other homes other than one home with a projecting  garage in the general area. He would prefer that the garage be integrated into the  dwelling.  D. DeNoble expressed that amendments to the plans have been made to reduce the  height of the dwelling to address the concerns raised at the previous meeting.  The Chair asked D. DeNoble is he was aware that they are agreeing to a maximum one  storey building height.  D. DeNoble replied yes.  J. Taylor noted that the applicant has agreed to a one storey building whereas a two  storey is permitted as of right. The increase converge is required to account for the  additional floor area that would have otherwise been captured in a second storey. He  asked the applicant if the garages could be mirrored from their proposed configuration  to reduce the visual impact to the neighbour to the north.  C. Calabrese was not in support of this configuration.  The Chair noted that the Committee will have to bring forward a motion on this  application.  S. Haslam asked the applicant if they would be open to reducing the lot coverage from  35% to 30%.  D. DeNoble and C. Calabrese were not in support of this amendment.  D. Wright stated that even at 30% lot coverage, a dwelling that exceeds that average  size of the existing neighbourhood homes could still be constructed.  Moved by: D. McCarroll   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  A motion was brought forward to approve the variances to (1) reduce the minimum  required lot frontage from 21.5m to 19.0m; (2) reduce the minimum required front yard  setback from 10.5m to 7.5m; (3) to reduce the minimum required lot area from 925 sq.  m to 725 sq. m; and (4) increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 20% to 30%  subject to the following conditions:  1. All Public Works requirements related to Land Division application LD 072/2021  are complied with;  2. The proposed covered front porch be limited to one storey in height and that the  main portion of the dwelling maintain a minimum 9.0m front yard setback;  3. The approved variances shall apply to the proposed dwelling typology as  illustrated on the applicants submitted site plan/elevation drawings (as presented  at this meeting);  4. That the building design be subject to Town of Whitby in-house architectural  control approval; and  5. The applicant receive final and binding approval from the Durham Region Land  Division Committee.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variances are  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/65/21  Steve DeNoble on behalf of Tammy Shannon  56 Meadow Crescent (Retained Lands)  An application has been received from Steve DeNoble on behalf of Tammy Shannon,  for variances from the provisions of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  On July 9, 2021 the original application was considered by the Town of Whitby  Committee of Adjustment. The Committee granted the following variances in principle:  (1) to reduce the minimum required lot frontage from 21.5m to 19.0m; (2) to reduce the  minimum required front yard setback from 10.5m to 7.5m; (3) to increase the maximum  permitted building height from 8.5m to 9.0m; and (4) to reduce the minimum required lot  area from 925 sq. m to 725 sq. m.  A requested variance to increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 20% to  35% was tabled to this meeting pending the Committee's review of a siting plan for the  proposed dwelling.  The requested variances are required to permit the severance of the subject property into  two parcels, and to also permit the construction of a detached dwelling on the subject  property.

D. DeNoble advised the Committee that his comments presented for the previous  application (A/64/21) are also applicable to this application.  C. Calabrese noted that if a motion is proposed by the Committee to approve a 30% lot  coverage for this application, he would like the 9.0m height variance not to be  withdrawn.  J. Taylor advised the Committee that the height variance was approved in principle at  the last meeting, but it would be up to the Committee to accept, deny, or revise the  variance based on the information presented.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  B. O'Carroll asked the applicant if there are any windows proposed in the outward  facing walls (north) of the garage.  C. Calabrese replied that there are no windows proposed on this face of the garage  facing the neighbouring properties. C. Calabrese noted that he could add windows if  that would assist.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  J. Malfara advised the Committee that public correspondence letters were received, and  these letters were forwarded to the Committee prior to this meeting.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.  K. Kelly asked the Committee if the approval would limit the height to a one storey  dwelling.  The Chair replied that this is up to the Committee members if a motion is brought  forward to adopt this condition.  D. Wright advised the Committee that over 30 residents have concerns with this  proposal and in his opinion 30% lot coverage is still too high.  M. Sigsworth asked if an 8.5m building height would permit 8 foot ceilings.  J. Malfara replied yes, but new modern homes with higher floor to ceiling heights  typically require increased overall building height permissions.  M. Sigsworth concluded that the overall building design should be respectful of the  neighbourhood.  S. Haslam asked if the applicant can go back and amend the previous application.  J. Taylor noted that once a decision has been made by the Committee they can not go  back and amend the decisions.

Snape explained to the Committee that she has consulted with the Town of Whitby  Building Department with respect to obtaining the required permits and approval to  legalize the basement apartment.

Chornobay, Chair  S. Haslam   J. Cardwell  B. O'Carroll  D. McCarroll  J. Taylor, Manager of Planning Administration   J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer  Item 1:  Disclosure of Interest:  There was no disclosure of interest by the members of the Committee of  Adjustment  Carried       Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee Of Adjustment  Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/70/18  The LaFrance Group on behalf of S. Gandhi and R. Bhargava  15 Annavita Court  An application has been received from The LaFrance Group on behalf of S. Gandhi and  R. Bhargava for a variance from the provisions of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-Law  1784.  The application is for permission to reduce the minimum required rear yard setback of  an existing accessory structure that includes a window facing the rear lot line from 7.5m  to 0.7m.  The requested variance is required to permit the continued use of an existing accessory  structure located within the rear yard of the subject property. A building permit was  issued by the Town of Whitby for the existing structure for which a rear yard facing  window was installed by the applicant after building permit issuance.  This Minor Variance application was considered at the November 8, 2018 Committee of  Adjustment meeting, but was tabled pending additional information from the applicant  regarding options to conform to the Ontario Building Code.  The subject property is located at 15 Annavita Court and is zoned Residential (R1A*)  within the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  In Support of Application  Paul LaFrance  In Opposition of Application  No one in attendance  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  P. LaFrance introduced himself to the Committee as the contractor tasked with  constructing the accessory structure located in the rear yard of the subject property. He  noted that this project was part of a television show, and after the project was started it  was determined that a window overlooking the open space would allow more natural  light into the accessory structure.  P. LaFrance expressed that he did not anticipate the installation of a new window being  an issue, even though it did not comply with the Zoning By-law. It was his opinion that  the intent of the By-law would be met.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.   Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  J. Cardwell asked the applicant if he has consulted with the Town of Whitby Building  Division regarding this application.  P. LaFrance replied yes. He has had conversations with the Building Division with  regards to the possible requirement of installing a fire shutter above the window in order  to satisfy the Ontario Building Code.  J. Cardwell asked the applicant if he was aware that the surface area of the window  may have to be reduced to comply with the limiting distance as outlined in the Ontario  Building Code.  P. LaFrance advised that he was aware.  B. O'Carroll asked the applicant if he was aware that after a building permit is issued the  building must be constructed per the approved permit drawings.  P. LaFrance replied yes. The installation of the window was a calculated risk as they  were in the midst of filming a television show.  B. O'Carroll advised that if the variance is approved the Committee will not know what  will be required for the applicant to satisfy the conditions of the Building Division.  P. LaFrance replied that after discussions with the Building Division he knows what is  required to comply with the Ontario Building Code.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara replied that no correspondence was received.  J. Taylor advised the Committee that a condition has been provided by the Town of  Whitby Building Division. This condition must be satisfied in order for the variance to be  in effect.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.  Moved by: J. Cardwell  That the application to reduce the minimum required rear yard setback of an existing  accessory structure that includes a window facing the rear lot line from 7.5m to 0.7m  located at 15 Annavita Court be Granted subject to the following conditions:  1. The site grading and all services shall conform to the requirements of the Public  Works Department;  2. Roof drainage from the existing structure shall not be directed onto the adjacent  property; and   Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  3. The maximum area of glazed openings in an exposed building face shall conform to  Table 9.10.15.4 of the 2012 Ontario Building Code Compendium and to the  satisfaction of the Town of Whitby Building Division.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variance is  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.   Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/71/18  Curtis and Paula Mulvaney  121 Hazelwood Drive  An application has been received from Curtis and Paula Mulvaney for a variance from  the provisions of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-Law 1784.  The application is for permission to increase the maximum permitted encroachment of a  covered porch projecting from the first storey of a dwelling unit into a required minimum  front yard from 1.5m to 1.95m.  The subject property is located at 121 Hazelwood Drive and is zoned Second Density  Residential (R2) in the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  The requested variance is required to permit the construction of a new porch projecting  from the first storey of a dwelling unit into a front yard.  In Support of Application  Curtis Mulvaney (Applicant)  Paula Mulvaney (Applicant)  In Opposition of Application  No one in attendance  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  C. Mulvaney introduced himself to the Committee as the owner of the subject property.  He advised the Committee that his intentions are to construct a covered front porch at  the front of the dwelling. C. Mulvaney stated that a porch can be constructed to comply  with the Zoning By-law, however, the size of the porch would be undesirable.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee. There were none.   The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara replied that no correspondence was received.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.   Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Moved by: D. McCarroll  That the application to increase the maximum permitted encroachment of a covered  porch projecting from the first storey of a dwelling unit into a required minimum front  yard from 1.5m to 1.95m located at 121 Hazelwood Drive be Granted subject to the  following conditions:  1. The site grading and all services shall conform to the requirements of the Public  Works Department; and  2. Roof drainage from the existing structure shall not be directed onto the adjacent  property.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variance is  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.   Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/72/18  Walter Walgate and Elizabeth Gallop  219 Bowman Ave  An application has been received from Walter Walgate and Elizabeth Gallop for  variances from the provisions of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-Law 2585.  The application is for permission to:  1. Reduce the minimum required interior side yard setback (north) from 0.38m to  0.0m to accommodate an existing car port; and  2. Reduce the minimum required interior side yard setback (north) to any soffit or  eaves from 0.3m to 0.0m.  The subject property is located at 219 Bowman Ave and is zoned Residential Type Two  (R2) in the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 2585.  The requested variances are required to recognize an existing 0.0m carport and eaves  setback to the northerly property line.  In Support of Application  Walter Walgate (applicant)   Elizabeth Gallop (applicant)  In Opposition of Application  Robert Bowman   Joan Bowman  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  E. Gallop introduced herself to the Committee as one of the owners of the subject  property. She advised the Committee that the property was purchased by W. Walgate in  2006, and when the property was purchased W. Walgate was instructed that there was  no existing property survey available. At the time of purchase, W. Walgate was made  aware that the north property line was signified by a concrete curb located in the front  yard and a chain-link fence located in the side and rear yard.  E. Gallop stated that two variances were approved in 2017 that allowed them to  increase the width of their carport to accommodate 2 parking spaces.  E. Gallop advised the Committee that after the carport was constructed, her neighbour  R. Bowman (221 Bowman Avenue) advised them that the carport support columns were  encroaching onto his property. A letter was also received by E. Gallop from R.  Bowman's lawyer advising of this issue.   Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  E. Gallop stated that in response to the letter received from R. Bowman's lawyer, she  and W. Walgate altered the base of the carport support columns to ensure that there  was no encroachment, roof leaders were diverted away from R. Bowman's property,  and a buried perforated drain pipe that was previously located between the two  properties was reinstalled.  E. Gallop further expressed that in her opinion the existing carport conforms to the  streetscape, it is an efficient use of space and is desirable, and received a building  permit from the Town.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  S. Haslam asked the applicants if they had a survey of the property.  W. Walgate replied no.  S. Haslam asked if the wood fence that abuts the north property line is owned by the  neighbour (R. Bowman).  W. Walgate replied yes.  S. Haslam asked the applicant if he grants the neighbour access to his property when  the fence requires repair, painting, etc.  W. Walgate replied that he previously provided approval for R. Bowman to access his  property when the fence required repair and/or maintenance.  J. Cardwell asked the applicant how the carport posts were sited.  W. Walgate replied that the contractor was responsible for installing the posts. The site  plan that was prepared for the contractor was based on the assumed property line  characterised by the concrete curb located between his property and 221 Bowman  Avenue.  S. Haslam asked the applicant who prepared the most recent survey works and if a  vertical survey was prepared as well.  W. Walgate replied that the survey staking was commissioned by his neighbour, R.  Bowman in 2018, and a vertical survey was not completed.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.  R. Bowman introduced himself as the owner of 221 Bowman Avenue, which is the  neighbouring property to the north. He expressed that in 2017 when the applicant's  submitted their original Minor Variance application, he submitted a letter of objection to  the Committee of Adjustment.   Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  R. Bowman expressed that he is objecting to the requested variances on the basis that  the Committee of Adjustment had already granted relief to the applicant in 2017.  R. Bowman confirmed that the existing wood fence situated between his property and  the applicant's property is owned by him and is located entirely on his property. The  fence was located on his property to allow for a perforated drain pipe to be installed  below grade between the two properties that spans from the rear yards to the street  line.  R. Bowman advised the Committee that the applicant removed the drain pipe as well as  paver stones that were located on his property during the construction of the carport. He  further noted that a surveyor was retained in 2018 at his expense to confirm the location  of the actual property line.  R. Bowman noted that he has since retained a lawyer in light of the observed issues.  The lawyer has provided letters to the applicant advising them of R. Bowman's  concerns.  The Chair asked if there was anyone else from the public who wished to speak to the  subject application.  J. Bowman introduced herself to the Committee also as an owner of 221 Bowman  Avenue. She expressed her objection with the requested variances and advised the  Committee that snow from the applicant's carport will blow off its roof and onto her side  yard walkway as a result of the reduced setback.  J. Bowman stated that anytime someone is constructing something they should obtain a  legal survey. She also noted that the concrete curb referenced by the applicant was  never a property line reference, and was only put in place after a flowerbed previously  located between her property and the applicant's property was removed.  B. O'Carroll asked where the perforated drain pipe is located.  R. Bowman replied that the pipe is situated on the common property line.  B. O'Carroll asked if the pipe is still connected.  R. Bowman replied yes. The pipe was reconnected after his lawyer contacted W.  Walgate.  J. Bowman stated that damage was done to their property and it has yet to be  remediated.  D. McCarroll asked if the eaves located on the new carport extension are connected to  the new drain pipe.  R. Bowman replied yes.   Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  The Chair asked if the roof of the carport encroaches past the property line.  R. Bowman advised that he does not know, but he intends to confirm this information  through a vertical survey.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara replied that no written correspondence was received, but he had a phone  conversation with R. Bowman.  B. O'Carroll stated that the damage was a separate issue from the requested variances.  R. Bowman replied that the damages would not have occurred if the applicant adhered  to the 2017 Minor Variance approval.  J. Taylor asked R. Bowman if the damages that he is referring to relates to the removal  of interlock brick on the south side of his wood fence.  R. Bowman replied yes.  S. Haslam asked if the side yard setback applies to the footing below grade or only to  the above grade structure.  J. Taylor replied that the setback is from the property line to the structure above grade,  however, no portion of any structure above or below grade shall encroach onto the  neighbouring lands.  The Chair asked if there was anyone else wishing to speak to the application. There  was no one.  S. Haslam stated that he was not in support of the variances and noted that the onus  was on the applicant to confirm the property boundary.  Moved by: S. Haslam  That the application to (1) reduce the minimum required interior side yard setback  (north) from 0.38m to 0.0m to accommodate an existing car port; and (2) reduce the  minimum required interior side yard setback (north) to any soffit or eaves from 0.3m to  0.0m located at 219 Bowman Ave be Denied.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variances do  not meet the general intent and purpose of the Zoning By-law.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, oral submissions had an effect on  the Committee's decision.   Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/73/18  RioKim Holdings (Ontario) Inc.  1629 Victoria Street East  An application has been received from RioKim Holdings (Ontario) Inc. for a variance  from the provisions of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-Law 1784.  The application is for permission to reduce the minimum single user unit size (Unit 15)  for any Retail Warehouse Facility use from 929.0 square metres to 599.0 square  metres.  The requested variance is required to permit a Retail Warehouse Use (tenant) to  occupy a 599.0 sq.m unit within the existing building.   The subject property is located at 1629 Victoria Street East and is zoned Automobile  Service Station/ Car Wash (AS-CW), and Special Purpose Commercial \u2013 Retail  Warehouse Exception 5 (C2-S-RW-5) in the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  In Support of Application  Oz Kemal (Agent)  Stuart Craig (Applicant)  In Opposition of Application  No one in attendance  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  O. Kemal introduced himself to the Committee as the applicants Planner. He stated that  the building located on the subject property was once occupied by the Sears Home  Store. Since the closing of the Sears Home Store his client has created new units within  the building and is in the process of leasing them to new tenants.  O. Kemal noted that Unit 15 is the smallest unit in the building, and the original intention  was to lease this space to a restaurant or financial institution. The surrounding area has  since become a hub for home furnishing stores and tenanting this unit (Unit 15) to a  restaurant or financial institution has proved unsuccessful.  O. Kemal also stated that a furniture store tenant (retail warehouse use) is currently  interested in leasing the space, and therefore a variance is required. No alterations to  the site plan or parking lot are proposed.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  B. O'Carroll stated that she had no concerns with the variance.   Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   The Chair asked if the variance will only apply to Unit 15.  J. Taylor replied that the variance could apply to the entire building if deemed  appropriate by the Committee. Recent discussions were conducted with the Region of  Durham Planning Department. The Region advised that their previous policies  regarding the minimum unit size for a retail warehouse use was not reflective of current  demands, and their new policies as adopted through ROPA 128 interprets that the  minimum retail warehouse size applies to the building as a whole and not individual  uses located within. The Town of Whitby Planning Department agrees with the Regions  policy interpretation.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara replied that no correspondence was received.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.  Moved by: B. O'Carroll  That the application to reduce the minimum single user unit size for any Retail  Warehouse Facility use from 929.0 square metres to 599.0 square metres located at  1629 Victoria Street East be Granted subject to the following condition:  1. That the site grading and all other services conform to the requirements of the Public  Works Department.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variance is  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.   Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/74/18  Mattamy (Monarch) Limited  1370 Dundas Street West  An application has been received from Mattamy (Monarch) Limited for a variance from  the provisions of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-Law 1784.

Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variance is  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.   Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/75/18  Mattamy (Monarch) Limited  1370 Dundas Street West  An application has been received from Mattamy (Monarch) Limited for variances from  the provisions of the Town of Whitby Zoning By-Law 1784.  The application is for permission to:   1. Reduce the minimum number of required commercial parking spaces from 14  spaces to 10 spaces;  2. Increase the maximum width of a private driveway on a lot serving a one car  garage from 4.4m to 7.0m;  3. Reduce the minimum rear yard setback to an unenclosed parking space from  2.75m to 0.2m; and  4. Amend the definition of a Street Townhouse Dwelling to include non-residential  floor space situated on the first storey of the building.  The subject property is located at 1370 Dundas St W and is zoned Mixed Use Two  (MX2) in the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  The requested variances are required to permit the development of five street  townhouse dwelling units fronting onto George Holley Street, with non-residential uses  located at the ground floor level.  In Support of Application  Mehr Hazari (Applicant)    Liana Dimaranan (Applicant)  In Opposition of Application  No one at this time.  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  M. Hazari introduced herself to the Committee and advised that the requested variances  are required to permit a proposed mixed-use block located at the north east corner of  George Holley Drive and Des Newman Boulevard.   With regards to variance #1, M. Hazari stated that the reduction in the number of  required commercial parking spaces is appropriate and that additional parking is located  in the private driveways located at the rear of the mixed use block.   With regards to variance #2, M. Hazari expressed that the variance is required to permit  the pairing of driveways located at the rear of the building. This would permit additional  parking on the site which may also be used for the ground floor commercial uses.    Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  With regards to variance #3, M. Hazari advised that the variance is appropriate and that  the sightlines from the street townhouse dwellings will be maintained.  With regards to variance #4, M. Hazari advised that the variance to the definition of a  street townhouse dwelling to require non-residential floor space on the ground floor will  ensure that a mixed use development is created and will safe guard the non-residential  use on the ground floor of each street townhouse unit.   The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.   B. O'Carroll asked if parking at the rear of the building can be used for users of the  ground floor commercial uses.   M. Hazari replied yes.  B. O'Carroll asked the applicant what uses may be permitted in the commercial units.   M. Hazari replied that uses such as a salon, barber, and other small scale commercial  use may be permitted.    J. Taylor advised the Committee that the building will be subject to architectural control  and the elevations will be reviewed by the Town of Whitby Planning Department.   M. Hazari circulated a conceptual rendering of the mixed use building to the Committee.   J. Cardwell asked the applicant if the entire ground floor will be for commercial uses.   M. Hazari replied that the majority of the ground floor will be dedicated for commercial  uses, however, stairways and hallways leading to the residential units on the floor  above will be excluded.   B. O'Carroll asked if the 2nd and 3rd floor will be residential.   M. Hazari replied yes.   J. Taylor advised the Committee that the proposed development will function in a similar  way to the existing mixed use building located north east of Baldwin Street and  Winchester Road East in Brooklin.  B. O'Carroll asked if a resident would be able to operate one of the ground floor  commercial units, and also live in the residential units above.   M. Hazari replied yes.    The Chair asked J.

M. Chipman noted that the proposed variance is similar in               nature to a      past variance  (A24/07) which was approved by the             Committee for his     property, to     permit the     reduced  rear yard     setback for a      building addition adjacent to the           east property line.

The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  J. Cardwell asked the applicant if his            existing shed was factored     into the     proposed  coverage.  M. Chipman replied yes.  S. Haslam asked the applicant for clarity on               the past variances       granted for     the subject  property.  J. Taylor replied that       a past variance       was approved,     which permitted a    reduced rear      yard setback for       a building addition adjacent         to the east property line. The past     variance  only applied     to that building addition and not the proposed               sun room     addition.

The application is for permission to:  1. reduce the minimum required rear yard setback to the existing garage from 6.0m  to 4.0m;  2. reduce the minimum required lot area from 835 sq.m to 676 sq.m; and  3. increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 20% to 30%  The subject     property is located      at 20     Heber Down Crescent     and is zoned      Third Density       Residential Brooklin Plan (R3-BP) within Zoning By-law               1784.   In Support of Application  Nigel O'Neill (Applicant)   In Opposition of Application      None at this       time   Also in    Attendance  James Hunter     (Resident)   Eleanor Holman     (Resident)  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  N. O'Neill introduced himself       to the     Committee and     noted that the       minor variances  applied for are required to satisfy a              condition of approval       as it pertains     to Land     Division  Application (LD/141/2017), which would see the             subject property severed into two lots.  N. O'Neill noted that the proposed variances shall               apply only to     the lands fronting onto  Heber Down Cres.    N. O'Neill also     expressed to     the Committee     that he has read the     Planning  Commissioners Report and       agreed with the     recommendation and     conditions of      approval.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee. There were none.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.  J. Hunter introduced     himself to the       Committee as the owner     of a neighbouring property      located at 23       Montgomery Avenue.    J. Hunter expressed to       the Committee that       he was seeking     a better     understanding of  the rear yard setback       variance to the existing garage.          Minutes of the 5th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         J. Taylor replied that       the applicant applied       for a land severance to         create two lots from  the current property. One of the variances recognizes             the setback     from the newly      established rear     lot line to the existing garage.          J. Taylor noted that there is no            proposal to move the     existing garage and       that any future        building on the subject property will have               to comply with       a 6.0m rear     yard setback.    J. Hunter asked the applicant if the home illustrated on                  the Site     Plan is the one the  applicant intends     to construct.  N. O'Neill replied that the         home illustrated on the Site       Plan is the      concept he     would like      to proceed with building.      The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that no             correspondence was received.  Moved by: J. Cardwell  That the application to (1) reduce the minimum required rear yard setback to the  existing garage from 6.0m to 4.0m; (2) reduce the minimum required lot area from 835  sq.m to 676 sq.m; and (3) increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 20% to  30% located at 20 Heber Down Crescent be Granted subject to the following  conditions:  1. That the site grading and all other services conform to the requirements of the Public  Works Department; and  2. That roof drainage from the proposed structure shall not be directed onto the  adjacent property.  3. Submission of an acceptable stormwater management brief and grading plan  showing how additional flows are accommodated without impacting the neighbouring  properties; and  4. That Variance No.1 shall only apply to the dwelling existing on the subject property  as of April 12, 2018.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of               the opinion that       the variance     is  minor in    nature; that     the general intent and       purpose of the       By-law and the      Official Plan is being        maintained, and further       that the granting of       the  application is desirable      and would result       in the     appropriate development     of  the property.    The contents of the staff report and oral submissions were considered and had an effect  on the Committee's decision.

The application is for permission to:  1. reduce the minimum required front yard setback from 9.0m to 8.2m;  2. reduce the minimum required lot area from 835 sq.m to 550 sq.m; and  3. increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 20% to 35%.  The subject property is located at 20 Heber Down Crescent and is zoned Third Density  Residential Brooklin Plan (R3-BP) within Zoning By-law 1784.  In Support of Application   Nigel O'Neill (Applicant)  In Opposition of Application   None at this time  Also in Attendance   James Hunter (Resident)  Eleanor Holman (Resident)  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  N. O'Neill introduced himself       to the     Committee and     noted that the       minor variances  applied for are required to satisfy a              condition of approval       as it pertains     to a    Land  Division Application (LD/141/2017), which         would see the subject     property severed     into  two lots.    N. O'Neill expressed to       the Committee that the proposed           lot fronting onto Montgomery  Avenue is fully serviced and the variances              are required     due to the       wide/shallow  configuration of the lot.        N. O'Neill further noted that he           agreed with the     Planning Commissioners     Report and      has submitted a      Stormwater Management Brief to the           Public Works     Department for      review.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee. There were none.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.  J. Hunter asked the applicant if the proposed dwelling                will have     a front yard setback     less  than the     neighbouring lots.    J. Taylor replied that       the neighbouring     property (north) will       be located     closer to  Montgomery Avenue than the         applicants proposed     dwelling.

Hunter asked the Committee to confirm             the reason for variance No.3.      J. Taylor replied that       the variance seeks to increase the             minimum required     lot coverage.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara confirmed     that no     correspondence was received.    Moved by: D. McCarroll  That the application to (1) reduce the minimum required front yard setback from 9.0m to  8.2m; (2) reduce the minimum required lot area from 835 sq.m to 550 sq.m; and (3)  increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 20% to 35% located at 20 Heber  Down Crescent be Granted subject to the following conditions:  1.

The application is for permission to:  1. increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 10% to 15%; and  2. reduce the minimum required interior side yard setback to an accessory structure  (detached garage) from 4.5m to 0.8m.  The subject     property is located      at 4700 Baldwin       Street South     and is    zoned Agricultural  (A) within Zoning By-law 1784.        In Support of Application  Paul Arsenault (Applicant)        In Opposition of Application      None at this       time   The Chair introduced       the application and       asked if    anyone would     like to speak to     the   subject application.      P. Arsenault introduced himself to the           Committee, and     advised that he is proposing a          detached garage     in the rear yard of           his property. The       detached garage is required      to  store his     work vehicles.    P. Arsenault expressed     that he     has contacted the Durham Region           Health Department      and the Central       Lake Ontario     Conservation Authority, and       they have     advised him that      there were no concerns with his           proposal.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  J. Cardwell asked the applicant if the existing shed                located on the property will     be  removed.  P. Arsenault replied that the current shed will be                 removed.  D. McCarroll asked     the applicant if he        had considered shifting     the shed     further away      from the interior lot         line.  P. Arsenault expressed     that he     had considered shifting       the shed further     from the     interior  lot line, but, the proposed location allows               the proposed detached     garage to     be in-line  with the existing driveway.        The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.

The application is for permission to increase the maximum permitted FSI from 45% to  54.1%.  The subject     property is located      at 304 Reynolds       Street and is zoned      Residential Type 1     \u2013 Downtown Zone (R1-DT) within Zoning By-law 2585.              In Support of Application   Paul Demczak (Applicant)  In Opposition of Application   Kenneth Boyle (Resident)  Kim Jackson (Resident)  Dave Jackson (Resident)  Chris Lansing (Resident)  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  P. Demczak introduced himself to the           Committee as the Planner     acting on behalf       of the      property owner and provided an           overview of the       requested variances.  P. Demczak noted that the existing building will be removed except                     for the foundation.     A  new 2.5 storey detached         dwelling is proposed to       be located     on top     of the     existing  foundation and all       zoning requirements will be       met except for the FSI.  P. Demczak advised the Committee that he             has read the Planning Commissioners        Report and agrees with         the recommendation and       conditions of     approval.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  S. Haslam asked the applicant if the            proposed 2.5 storey       building would require     a height  variance.  P. Demczak replied that the proposed dwelling             will not     exceed the maximum     permitted  building height.    D. McCarroll asked     the applicant if the development would            entail a full demolition of       the  existing dwelling.    P. Demczak replied that the all of             the existing dwelling will         be removed, except       for the  foundation. The new building will be constructed             atop of the     retained foundation.  Minutes of the 5th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment                                                                                                                                                                                                              The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.  K. Boyle introduced himself as a          resident of 302       Reynolds Street, and requested  clarification as to why the           Zoning By-law was     amended in 2017.    The Chair responded that the Zoning By-law is a document that is continually being  updated and amended, which includes site specific amendments as well as Zoning  By-law consolidations.  K. Boyle expressed to the         Committee that he       has invested     a considerable amount of  money into his home and his             landscaping over the       past 16 years,       and does not want a  neighbouring home     which can     devalue his property.      The Chair replied that the applicants proposed dwelling will be constructed on the  foundation of the existing dwelling, and that the only notable change will be the height of  the structure, which complies with the Zoning By-law.  K. Jackson introduced herself to the Committee as the                 owner of 306       Reynolds Street,      and noted that she was           not supportive     of the proposed       tear down and proposed     height.  J. Taylor replied that       the Zoning     permits a maximum building       height of     three storeys on  the subject property.  K. Jackson asked     the applicant if the        area above the second     floor will     be a    loft or     a full  floor.  P. Demczak replied that the small area located               above the second     storey will be     a loft.    K. Jackson asked     when the owner intends to         begin construction.  P. Demczak replied that the owner would             like to begin       construction as     soon as possible.    C. Lansiny introduced himself to the           Committee as the owner     of 502 Dunlop     Street E.    C. Lansiny noted that he was           in attendance at an Ontario           Municipal Board hearing     and  that the     proposed new single detached dwellings           located north of       Trafalgar Castle     will  be a    maximum of     two storeys in height      and therefore     he would like the     applicant to limit      the proposed building to       two storeys     as well.  S. Haslam replied that the Committee can             not impose     this restriction as     the Zoning By- law permits a maximum three storey            building height.    P. Demczak noted that proposed loft projecting slightly               above the second     storey will be      located at the       centre of the building to reduce             impacts on adjacent land uses.          The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara replied that no correspondence was received.

Presentations    2.1  John Sanderson, President and Chief Executive Officer, Whitby Hydro  Energy Corporation, Troy MacDonald, Partner, Grant Thornton and Ron  Clark, Partner, Aird & Berlis   Re: Potential Merger - Veridian Corporation and Whitby Hydro Energy  Corporation   John Sanderson, President and Chief Executive Officer, Whitby Hydro   Special Council Minutes   April 25, 2018 - 7:00 PM    Energy Corporation, Troy MacDonald, Partner, Grant Thornton and Ron  Clark, Partner, Aird & Berlis appeared before Council and provided a  PowerPoint presentation pertaining to the potential merger of Veridian  Corporation and Whitby Hydro Energy Corporation. Key highlights of the  presentation included:  \u2022 an overview of the merger process to date including background  information outlining the rationale of the merger proposal;  \u2022 the collaboration undertaken thus far in the merger process  including the engagement of stakeholders and conducting of  independent valuations and reviews;  \u2022 the benefits of the proposed merger including savings to Whitby  ratepayers, stronger and more sustainable cash flow, more  efficient use of resources and improved customer service;  \u2022 the merits and concerns surrounding the option to sell and the  option to remain status quo;  \u2022 the changing industry landscape, pressures for Local Distribution  Companies (LDCs) and the increased options available to  customers through Distributed Energy Resources (DERs);  \u2022 rate harmonization to ensure that all customers are experiencing  benefits from the merger relative to their stand-alone  expectations;  \u2022 savings through economies of scale, eliminating duplication and  improved operational ability with increased resources to respond  to outages and emergencies if the merger were to occur;  \u2022 benefits for municipal shareholders and increases in dividend  payout ratios over time;  \u2022 the risks of merging versus not merging;   \u2022 the governance model of the newly merged company and the  collaborative mix of skills and experience to bring the best value  to customers; and,  \u2022 next steps in the process.    3.  Public Input    3.1  Public Input  John Ecker, 113 Whitburn Street, appeared before Council and stated  that he had a long time interest in hydro and energy issues, as he had  been adversely affected by costly provincial energy policies over the last  15 years. He provided examples of such policies, and advised that  based on the research he has conducted and his own personal  experience, he was supportive of the proposed merger.   He further advised that he had reviewed all of the documents available  regarding the proposed merger, and it represented a good opportunity  Page 2 of 4  Special Council Minutes   April 25, 2018 - 7:00 PM    for Whitby for five reasons:   \u2022 The merger was not a sale, as the resulting entity would remain  in public hands;   \u2022 The resulting merged company will remain rooted in Durham  Region with Whitby having the largest share;   \u2022 The new company will have more resources and greater  capability;   \u2022 The Town of Whitby, as a majority stakeholder, would continue to  receive increased sustainable dividends; and  \u2022 Customers would enjoy greater rate certainty under the new  company.       3.2  Public Input  Czarina Puentespina, 21 Westport Drive, appeared before the  Committee, and requested information regarding the improvement in  customer experience if the merger were to proceed. She advised that  currently there were not many self-service options with Whitby Hydro,  and the hours of operation for the company were not conducive to those  residents who were in the workforce. She further inquired about  employment opportunities with the newly merged company, and whether  it would affect classification densities within the Town.   Mr. Sanderson returned to the delegation table and discussion ensued  regarding:   \u2022 The opportunity to provide more self-service options due to an  increase in resources with the newly merged company;   \u2022 The potential for new employment opportunities within Durham  related to new technology; and  \u2022 The importance of harmonizing rates with Veridian.   A question and answer period ensued between Members of Council and  Mr. Sanderson with respect to:   \u2022 The composition of the Board of the newly merged company; and  \u2022 The difference between a HoldCo and an OpCo, and their  respective responsibilities and governance.

Mr. Lawrence advised he met with Planning and  Development Department Staff prior to this meeting to obtain more  information about the proposed development but that Staff were unable  to disclose additional information citing privacy concerns. Mr. Lawrence  stated he is aware of other developments being proposed or under  construction that are only going to be 6 stories in height. He stated there  are no similar projects in the Town that are this tall and this close to  residential areas. He further stated that he is not opposed to growth but  there are other spots that this development can go in the Town. Mr.  Lawrence advised that his family lives in the area and he hopes the  Committee will vote against the development.  A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of the  Committee and Mr. Lawrence regarding:  \u2022 a lack of contact with the developer and the community regarding  the concerns of the community; and,  \u2022 the main issue of the development being the height.      2.5  Shawn Lowes  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 71-19  Zoning By-law Amendment Application, DEV-19-18 (Z-31-18), 1201 &  1207 Brock Street South and 1200 &1202 Green Street, Bara Group  (Whitby) Inc.    Refer to Item 4.1, PL 71-19  Shawn Lowes, 203 Clemence Street, appeared before the Committee  and stated that if the development proposal is approved it will alter the  community. Mr. Lowes advised that he lives two doors down from the  proposed development and would have bought elsewhere if he knew  that this type of development was possible. He stated that the  community has worked together in opposition of the proposal and that  the proposal does not meet Whitby's vision or Official Plan principles.  Page 4 of 16  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 09, 2019 - 7:00 PM    He indicated that the proposed height and density will impact privacy,  traffic, parking, walkability, safety, and climate. Mr. Lowes stated that the  community is realistic, recognizes the value of the land, and would  support smaller scale development. Mr. Lowes advised that a meeting  was setup with the developer and consultant but the developer did not  attend and has not considered feedback from the community. He stated  that the community has collected over 250 signatures opposing the  development and he requested that the Committee vote against the  proposal.      2.6  Katelyn Lawson  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 71-19  Zoning By-law Amendment Application, DEV-19-18 (Z-31-18), 1201 &  1207 Brock Street South and 1200 &1202 Green Street, Bara Group  (Whitby) Inc.    Refer to Item 4.1, PL 71-19  Katelyn Lawson, 1201 Green Street, appeared before the Committee  and stated that her and her husband moved to the community just one  year ago. Ms. Lawson stated she is an economic planning consultant  and has worked on many large North American development projects.  She further stated she has reviewed the proposal and was surprised to  see no community outreach had taken place. She stated that the  developer's lack of community engagement is a misstep. Ms. Lawson  advised that the land to be developed appears to extend beyond the  intensification boundary, traffic data is left out that does not support the  plan, wrong assumptions were made regarding growth factors, and two  additional storeys have been added for utilities and a penthouse. She  further stated that Whitby is beginning to recognize the importance of  sustainability and the impact of climate change but the developer does  not consider these items. Ms. Lawson stated that if the Committee votes  in favour of the proposal it will be a failure and that they need to ensure  the Official Plan is upheld while getting the community a seat at the  table.  A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of the  Committee and Ms. Lawson regarding:  \u2022 a traffic analysis prepared by Ms. Lawson having been provided  to Members of Council;  \u2022 details on contraventions of the Town's Official Plan being  provided by Ms. Lawson in an email to the Clerk;  \u2022 Green Street and vehicle trips not being included in the Traffic  Impact Study; and,  \u2022 the Region of Durham recognizing safety concerns with the  Page 5 of 16  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 09, 2019 - 7:00 PM    intersection adjacent to the development but not having the ability  to address the concerns due to lands owned by the Ministry of  Transportation.        2.7  Frank D'Onofrio  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 71-19  Zoning By-law Amendment Application, DEV-19-18 (Z-31-18), 1201 &  1207 Brock Street South and 1200 &1202 Green Street, Bara Group  (Whitby) Inc.    Refer to Item 4.1, PL 71-19  Frank D'Onofrio, 1007 Athol Street, appeared before the Committee and  stated that he is in opposition to the proposal. Mr. D'Onofrio stated that  the proposal needs to be considered on its own merit and that the  Official Plan and policies are just tools. He further stated that two to  eight storeys are permitted in high-density residential areas under the  Town's Official Plan but the proposed development creates a stark  contrast with single storey dwellings on one side and an eight storey  building on the other. He stated that the destruction of mature trees is  troubling and that the cash in lieu provided may be compliant with the  Town's Official Plan but is not acceptable to the community. Mr.  D'Onofrio also stated that there are inadequacies with the traffic study  as Brock Street intersections are already at capacity without the  proposed building. He advised that an informal traffic count was  completed by residents in the community and found much higher results  than the results in the study. Mr. D'Onofrio stated that overall the study  prepared by the applicant greatly underestimates the impact of traffic  and available parking.      2.8  Sue Honderich  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 71-19  Zoning By-law Amendment Application, DEV-19-18 (Z-31-18), 1201 &  1207 Brock Street South and 1200 &1202 Green Street, Bara Group  (Whitby) Inc.    Refer to Item 4.1, PL 71-19  Sue Honderich, 1109 Green Street, appeared before the Committee and  stated that she was a part of additional meetings with Bara Group and  listened to questions, but answers were never provided. Ms. Honderich  stated that there has been a lack of community engagement, but that  the biggest issue with the development is invasion of privacy. She also  stated that a building of this proposed height adjacent to single family  dwellings will reduce privacy in front and back yards and reduce  Page 6 of 16  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 09, 2019 - 7:00 PM    sunlight, while more density will lead to more crime. Ms. Honderich  advised that there is a large senior population in the community and it is  already difficult to cross the road to get to the mailbox which will be right  in front of the proposed development. She requested that the Committee  vote against this proposal.       2.9  Shellie Taylor  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 71-19  Zoning By-law Amendment Application, DEV-19-18 (Z-31-18), 1201 &  1207 Brock Street South and 1200 &1202 Green Street, Bara Group  (Whitby) Inc.    Refer to Item 4.1, PL 71-19  Shellie Taylor, 1126 Green Street, appeared before the Committee and  stated that she is a police dispatcher and that the workload of  emergency services increases with increases in population. Ms. Taylor  stated that public safety is at risk at Brock Street and the Highway 401  area as a result of this proposal because it is a main route for  emergency vehicles. Ms. Taylor stated that her son had been hit by car  in this area and that the Region already has a shortage of emergency  services. She also stated that the area is over populated and this  proposal will create safety concerns, affect privacy, and that the addition  of commercial units would likely draw people to the area beyond those  who live nearby. Ms. Taylor advised that she works shifts so the  construction will impact her and that she is concerned about the  proposal due to the schools nearby and the added traffic.      2.10 Katy Francis  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 71-19  Zoning By-law Amendment Application, DEV-19-18 (Z-31-18), 1201 &  1207 Brock Street South and 1200 &1202 Green Street, Bara Group  (Whitby) Inc.    Refer to Item 4.1, PL 71-19  Katy Francos, 1001 Athol Street, appeared before the Committee and  stated her son was hit by a car during the provincial election when a  polling station was located nearby and traffic was busier than normal.  Ms. Francos stated that the investigation of the incident showed it was  an accident but that awareness of traffic has heightened in the area as a  result. She also stated that when they heard of the proposal she was  immediately concerned about more vehicles in the area. She indicated  that the the traffic study did not include a number of area streets, some  that were less than 400 metres away from the proposed site. Ms.  Page 7 of 16  Committee of the Whole Minutes   September 09, 2019 - 7:00 PM    Francos stated that she conducted her own traffic count and counted  170 vehicles pass in a 30 minute timeframe. She also stated that the  school population has grown and that the number of vehicles will  increase as well. Ms. Francos stated that the traffic impact study does  not give a full picture of traffic in the area and therefore a decision  should not be made with incomplete data. Ms. Francos advised that the  Durham Zero Vision Strategy contains a 10% reduction of fatal injury  collisions and that adding more vehicles to the traffic system will  endanger residents. She stated that she is strongly opposed to the  development and is disappointed to hear that the recommendation is to  approve the development, given the safety concerns.      2.11 Arun Blake  Re: Planning and Development Department Report, PL 71-19  Zoning By-law Amendment Application, DEV-19-18 (Z-31-18), 1201 &  1207 Brock Street South and 1200 &1202 Green Street, Bara Group  (Whitby) Inc.    Refer to Item 4.1, PL 71-19  Arun Blake, 310 Saint Lawrence Street, appeared before the Committee  and stated that he can see the history of the area through the different  houses in the neighbourhood. He indicated that the neighbourhood  already has many new developments as a result of the GO Station and  Highway 401 expansion. Mr. Blake stated that the area can get loud,  and the loss of greenery and increase in traffic are concerns for the  community. He stated that he thought there was a possibility for traffic  lights at the intersection of Saint Lawrence Street and Brock Street but,  if true, Saint Lawrence Street runs the risk of becoming a thoroughfare.    3.  Correspondence    3.1  There was no correspondence.    4.

Mr. Jordan advised that they had  already prepared the plan of subdivision for this parcel of land prior to  being informed that the cultural heritage impact assessment was  needed, and as such, were bringing it to the Committee for  consideration at a later date than intended. Ms. Uchiyama provided an  overview of the reasons that the property should be delisted, including:   \u2022 The look of the property, which originally presented as a mid-19th  century Georgian classic vernacular building, but had undergone  significant interventions throughout the years that have lessened  its heritage value;   \u2022 The side gables having returning eaves which would elude to  modification;  \u2022 The brick chimneys situated at the north and south ends of the  structure which appear to have been constructed at different  times;   \u2022 The headers along the second floor window openings having  been removed and clad in stucco;   \u2022 The frieze and the windows around the structure having been  replaced; and  \u2022 The capped concrete around the structure's foundation being  consistent with repairs and replacement over time.   A question and answer period ensued between Members of the  Committee and Ms. Uchiyama with respect to:   \u2022 Details regarding the replacement of the windows, and additions  of structures to the back of the building;   \u2022 Reasons for not considering this property as part of the Robb  Property; and  \u2022 Potential for the developer to honour the Robb and McGowan  families that were original settlers in this area, by naming a park  or street after the families.       Recommendation:  Page 2 of 7  Heritage Whitby Advisory Committee Minutes   February 13, 2018 - 7:00 PM      Moved By Joyce Marshall    Notwithstanding cultural significance, in reviewing the structural  deficiencies and changes to the original building located at 3425  Coronation Road, it is determined that its historical integrity has been  compromised. As a result, the Heritage Whitby Advisory Committee  recommends that the building be delisted from the Heritage Register.  Furthermore, due to the cultural association of the Robb and McGowan  families, the Committee recommends that the Developer work with the  Town to name certain parks and/or streets within the development to  commemorate the families.     Carried  4.  General Business and Reports    4.1  45 Cassels Road - Update  Stacey Kursikowski provided an update on the property located at 45  Cassels Road, being the Old Brooklin Community Centre. She advised  that the Town was moving forward with a survey, and she would be  providing a draft reference plan to the Committee for their review at the  March 13, 2018 meeting.   Discussion ensued regarding:   \u2022 Lot lines on the property and the impact on road widenings;  \u2022 Timeline for the matter being brought to the Planning and  Development Committee;   \u2022 Investigating any new processes for registration with the Registry  Office;   \u2022 Flankage on Church Street and how that would impact lot lines;  and  \u2022 Whether the parcel of land includes the old township and the  cemetery.       4.2  Highway 407 Properties - Delisting Reports Update   Stacey Kursikowski distributed a map to Committee Members that  outlined the 13 properties that were demolished due to the building of  Highway 407 and Highway 412, and advised that the report detailing this  matter would be considered at the Planning and Development  Committee meeting scheduled for February 26, 2018.

Ms.  Page 3 of 7  Heritage Whitby Advisory Committee Minutes   February 13, 2018 - 7:00 PM    Kursikowski advised that upon further review, a separate report would  be prepared to request that this property be delisted, if required, and  would be presented to the Planning and Development Committee at a  later date.       4.3  Various Other Delisting Properties \u2013 Report (8205 Baldwin St N, 124  Brock St N, 465 Townline Rd W, 76 Queen St)  Stacey Kursikowski provided an overview of the reasoning behind  delisting the four properties as noted, and advised that a report would be  going to the February 26, 2018 Planning and Development meeting for  review:   8205 Baldwin Street North:  Single family dwelling with two barns, with one of the barns being of  interest as it was built in 1875. Due to the fact that the other dwellings  have been demolished and the barn is no longer in good condition, and  not of heritage value, it is recommended that this property be delisted.   124 Brock Street North:  Due to the recent fire at this property, it is recommended that it be  delisted so that redevelopment can occur in the area.   465 Townline Road West:  It was determined that this building was built in 1987, and is a replica of  an old flagstone building. Although it may retain some heritage interest  in coming years as a replica building, it holds no heritage value at this  time.   76 Queen Street:  This was a 1.5 storey structure built in 1910 that was demolished in  2010 due to a fire, and the site has since been redeveloped.   It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 4.6 at this time.      4.4  Articles for Spring 2018 Heritage Matters Newsletter  John Ecker advised that Heather Kearney had volunteered to write an  article for the Spring 2018 Newsletter, and asked for topic suggestions.  Discussion ensued regarding:   \u2022 Writing an article on the moving of the cenotaph from Luther  Vipond Arena to the Brooklin Community Centre and Library;   \u2022 An article on the walking tour of the Werden's Plan or key  buildings that are part of the Doors Open Event;   Page 4 of 7  Heritage Whitby Advisory Committee Minutes   February 13, 2018 - 7:00 PM    \u2022 Creating a short article promoting the Doors Open Event;   \u2022 The construction occuring within the Land Registry Office as a  result of a contract awarded to North American Contractors  Limited; and   \u2022 Preparing the articles for April 2018 so that the newletter can be  published by May, in advance of the Doors Open event.   John Ecker advised that he would work with a member of the Legion to  write the article on the Brooklin Cenotaph, and Stacey Kursikowski  would draft the article on the Doors Open Event. Mr. Ecker further  advised that he would ask Ms. Kearney to work on an article on the R.A.  Sennett Building, which was part of the Doors Open Event. Sarah  Ferencz would prepare an article on the modifications to the Land  Registry Office.       4.5  Event Ideas for 2018  Discussion ensued with respect to the events that the Committee could  attend in 2018, and potential themes for the booth that could entice  people, especially children, to learn more about Heritage matters. It was  the consensus of the Committee that due to a limited budget, the theme  would be the same for all events attended, and the Committee would  only participate in two events: the Harvest Festival and the new Open  Streets event to replace Heritage Day in Downtown Whitby as outlined  in Report CAO 18-17. Further discussion ensued regarding:   \u2022 Finalizing a theme for the event, being Whitby's Famous People,  and having a booth with  cardboard cut-outs of two famous  people, with the faces cut out so that attendees could take  pictures as the famous people;  \u2022 Finalizing a male and female Famous Figure, with one being Bob  Attersley and the second being a woman which could be  determined at a later date;  \u2022 Mounting a large posterboard depicting a timeline of important  events as an attraction for the HWAC booth, in addition to the  Famous Figures cut-outs, and distributing bookmarks that  showed specific time periods; and  \u2022 Creating colouring sheets of the Famous Figures to use as  giveaways for children at the booth.  Vince Santamaura advised that he would check with a contact in printing  to determine costs for the photos of the Famous Figures.   Sarah Ferenz advised that she would review archives to determine  appropriate pictures for both figures.   Councillor Gleed advised that he would assist in mounting the pictures  Page 5 of 7  Heritage Whitby Advisory Committee Minutes   February 13, 2018 - 7:00 PM    onto the pieces of plywood and cutting the hole for the heads, so that  people could take pictures as the historic figures.       4.6  68 Way Street \u2013 Plaque Wording Review  Stacey Kursikowski distributed copies of the Plaque wording for the  Committee's review. Discussion ensued regarding:  \u2022 Reasoning for the property being named \"Whitby Mills\" when in  fact it was one flour mill;   \u2022 Using the Atlas photograph for the cairn on this property as  opposed to Mr. Bickell's photograph;   \u2022 Utilizing the Blipper app to have a QR code that provides more  information on the property; and  \u2022 Providing details of the ceremony to the Committee, so that  Members could attend.   Rick McDonnell advised that he would consult with Brian Winter  regarding the suggested wording and advise if he had any other  suggested changes.   It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 4.4 at this time.       4.7  Heritage Whitby Advisory Committee Annual Report   John Ecker advised that he was working on the Annual Report and  would distribute it to the Committee for their review in the next few  weeks, prior to the March meeting. Stacey Kursikowski advised that she  would place this item on the March 13, 2018 Heritage Whitby Advisory  Committee agenda.     5.  Correspondence    5.1  Whitby Water Supply Plant Expansion EA  (correspondence provided under separate cover)  John Ecker advised that the Committee was an interested party in this  matter and would have the opportunity to provide input as it moves  forward.  Brief discussion ensued with respect to the aesthetics of the project and  the impact on the Pumphouse project and the Whitby shoreline.     6.  Council Update    6.1  Councillor Gleed provided information regarding:   \u2022 Designating the municipal lands along Whitby's waterfront as a  Page 6 of 7  Heritage Whitby Advisory Committee Minutes   February 13, 2018 - 7:00 PM    park, with the park boundaries to include the Rowe House to the  open space block at Brock and Front Streets;   \u2022 The technology hub in the Land Registry Office and the types of  jobs and innovation it would bring to Whitby;   \u2022 Report LS 05-18 which would renumber certain urban and rural  properties in order to make them more visible and accessible to  emergency services;  \u2022 Council Chambers renovations and timelines; and  \u2022 The creation of a Whitby Walk of Fame along Brock Street in  front of the Brock Street Brewery.     7.  Other Business    7.1  Margaret Clayton advised that she was working with other members of  the Committee in order to clean up the Heritage Register and determine  which properties could be removed. She further advised that once there  were enough properties, the Committee could have a meeting to go  through them all and delist if necessary.     8.

The application is for permission to permit vehicular access to the garage from the front  yard, whereas the by-law requires that the vehicular access on a lot abutting a  roundabout be taken from the exterior side lot line.  The subject property is located at 915 Rossland Road West (Lot 69) and is zoned Low  Density (LD) within the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.

L. Dimaranan introduced herself to the Committee as the applicant. She provided an  overview of the variance and noted that the driveway is proposed within the front yard  as opposed the exterior side yard since road abutting the exterior side yard has a  greater amount of traffic and it is more desirable and safe to have driveway access from  the front yard which abuts a less busy roadway.  The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that no correspondence was received.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.

Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variance is  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.

The application is for permission to: (1) reduce the minimum lot frontage for a semi- detached dwelling containing an accessory apartment from 10.0m to 9.1m; and (2) reduce  the minimum required front yard landscaped coverage from 40% to 38%.  The subject property is located at 49 Glenmore Drive and is zoned Single Family Semi- Detached Dwelling House (R3B) within the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 2585.In   Support of Application      Ravi Gajula (Applicant)   In Opposition of Application  Ann Lindsay    Phil Bingham    Vidal Guerreiro  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  R. Gajula introduced himself to the Committee as the new owner of the subject  property. He advised the Committee that he would like to construct an accessory  apartment within the basement of the dwelling.   The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.   J. Cardwell asked if the applicant is proposing widening on the south side of the  driveway.   J. Malfara replied yes.   J. Cardwell asked if the existing driveway width is wide enough for two cars and also  asked if the garage is useable for parking.   R. Gajula replied yes.   S. Haslam asked if the driveway will be wide enough for two side by side parking  spaces after accounting for the removal of asphalt abutting the south lot line.   J. Malfara replied yes.  B. O'Carroll asked if the area to be removed along the south portion of the driveway will  be added to the north side of the driveway.    Minutes of the 15th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  J. Malfara replied yes. He noted that this is required in order for the driveway to be 5.5m  in width.   The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that letters of objection were received and were  forwarded to the Committee in advance of the meeting.   The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.   A. Lindsay introduced herself to the Committee as the original owner of the applicants  dwelling. She noted that prior to her ownership of the property, the driveway was  illegally widened to sit flush with the south lot line. She asked why the Town is asking  the applicant to create a 0.6m setback/landscape buffer to the south lot line.   The Chair advised A. Lindsay that the current By-law requires that a driveway shall be  setback a minimum of 0.6m from an interior lot line within a front yard.   A. Lindsay noted that this property has the smallest frontage in the neighbourhood and  that this home was constructed as single family dwelling, and permitting rental units will  change the character of the neighbourhood.  The Chair noted that the accessory apartment is permitted and Provincial legislation  supports accessory apartments within ground oriented dwellings.   A. Lindsay asked why the driveway can not stay the same without creating the  landscape strip along the south side of the property.   J. Malfara stated that a driveway shall be setback a minimum of 0.6m from an interior lot  line within a front yard, and in this scenario the driveway will require a minimum width of  5.5m to accommodate two legal parking spaces side by side.  The Chair noted that notwithstanding the variances, the applicant will also be required  to obtain a successful building permit for the proposed apartment dwelling.   B. O'Carroll asked how many bedrooms will be located in the apartment unit.   R. Gajula replied one bedroom.   The Chair asked if the basement is currently operating as an accessory apartment.   R. Gajula replied no.    J. Cardwell asked the applicant if they have spoken with the Building Department about  the permitting process.   R. Gajula replied yes, and a permit will be filed following the minor variance process.    Minutes of the 15th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  The Chair asked if there were any other members of the public wishing to speak to the  application.   P. Bingham introduced himself to the Committee as the owner of 39 Glenmore Drive.  He asked if the applicant will be residing in the dwelling.   R. Gajula replied that he will be living in the dwelling.  P. Bingham asked why an apartment is permitted in a single family dwelling.   J. Malfara clarified that this property is zoned for a detached dwelling and the single  family verbiage does not necessarily mean only one family can be living within the  dwelling. J. Malfara noted that the Province has provided directives that encourage  accessory apartment dwelling units within all ground oriented dwellings and the Towns  By-law reflects this by allowing accessory apartments currently within single detached  dwellings and semi-detached dwellings.  P. Bingham questions if these types of properties are the most suitable for accessory  apartments versus properties with dwellings containing two car garages and larger  driveway.   The Chair asked if there were any other members of the public wishing to speak to the  application.   V. Guerreiro introduced himself to the Committee as the owner of the neighbouring  property to the south. He advised the Committee that he understands the Provincial  policy directives.   V. Guerreiro noted that R. Gajula is welcomed addition to the neighbourhood, but has  some concerns with the proposed accessory apartment use.   V. Guerreiro noted that the proposed driveway reconfiguration to create a 0.6m setback  to the south lot line is appropriate, but expressed concern with regards to the  preservation of the existing street tree located on the north side of the driveway within  the Town's boulevard.   V. Guerreiro further expressed concerns with regards to waste collection, the potential  for additional on-street parking, as well as noise and light impacts that may result from  future tenants entering the accessory apartment through a proposed side yard entry.   Related to the proposed access door into the accessory apartment, V. Guerre noted  that the distance separating his dwelling and the applicant's dwelling is minimal.   J. Malfara noted that the Zoning By-law does not include lighting provisions, but noted  that it is good practice to only install down-lit lighting fixtures, and with regards to the  proposed side yard entry, this is permitted as of right by the Zoning By-law based on the  existing side yard setbacks of the applicant's dwelling.   The Chair asked if there were any other members of the public wishing to speak to the  application. There was no one.    Minutes of the 15th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Moved by: J. Cardwell  That the application to (1) reduce the minimum lot frontage for a semi-detached dwelling  containing an accessory apartment from 10.0m to 9.1m; and (2) reduce the minimum  required front yard landscaped coverage from 40% to 38% located at 49 Glenmore  Drive be Granted subject to the following condition:  1. That a 0.6m setback be provided between the driveway and south lot line.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variances are  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.     Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/89/21  YEJ Studio and Consulting  68 Summerside Ave  An application has been received from YEJ Studio and Consulting for variances from  the provisions of By-Law 1784.  The application is for permission to: (1) reduce the minimum number of parking spaces  dedicated to an accessory apartment dwelling unit from 1 to 0; and (2) permit an  accessory apartment within a link dwelling having a minimum lot frontage of 9.0m.  The subject property is located at 68 Summerside Avenue and is zoned Residential  (R3A*) within the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  In Support of Application  Hassan Robah (Applicant)   In Opposition of Application  None at this time.  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  H. Robah introduced himself to the Committee and provided an overview of the  requested variance. He advised the Committee that he reviewed the Staff Report and  agreed with the recommendation to table the application to a future meeting, which  would allow them to address the comments provided by the Engineering Services  Department.   The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.   S. Haslam noted that the Committee historically has not supported private parking on  the Town's boulevards.   J. Malfara noted that this has been the case, and this typically stemmed from comments  provided by the Engineering Services Department as this is the department that  regulates uses and activities that occur within the Town's boulevards. In this instance,  the Engineering Services Department has expressed to the applicant that they would  like to review a brief to justify the lack of parking space and how it will be addressed  before supporting or objecting to the applicant's request.   The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application. There was none.   The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.     Minutes of the 16th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment  Moved by: B. O'Carroll  That the application to (1) reduce the minimum number of parking spaces dedicated to  an accessory apartment dwelling unit from 1 to 0; and (2) permit an accessory  apartment within a link dwelling having a minimum lot frontage of 9.0m located at 68  Summerside Ave be Tabled to the next available Committee of Adjustment meeting  pending input from the Engineering Services Department.

Stewart, Partner, Deloitte LLP, provided an overview of the 2020  Year End Communication and Financial Statements. Mr. Stewart noted  that the financial statements present fairly the financial position of the  Corporation as of December 31, 2020 in accordance with Canadian  Public Sector Accounting Standards (PSAS). He indicated that the audit  focused on risk, with more attention paid to higher risk areas. He  advised that significant risks include revenue recognition due to its  complexity and management override controls which is required to be  treated as high risk under Canadian auditing standards. He noted that  Page 1 of 3  Audit Committee Minutes   September 08, 2021 - 2:00 PM    revenue recognition is complex due to the collection of development  charges and government grants, including government grants received  during the COVID-19 pandemic. He advised that the materiality level  used for the 2020 audit was $4.4 million, and that no misstatements or  errors were identified. Mr. Stewart advised that the audit is now largely  complete and that there are no subsequent events that should modify  the results and that he would be in a position to issue a final opinion  after today's meeting.

Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Lee    Whereas according to the National Autism Spectrum Disorder  Surveillance System (NASS), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of  the most common developmental disabilities in Canada with 1 in 66  children being diagnosed with ASD;    Whereas according to the Canadian Medical Association Journal,  approximately 1 percent of the Canadian population is affected by ASD,  which means there are over 100,000 Ontarians on the autism spectrum;    Whereas the Province of Ontario must be prepared to support children  and adults within the context of development, learning, family and  community, ensuring that each person with ASD is provided with the  means to achieve a high quality of life;    Whereas the Province of Ontario must support the individual needs of a  person with ASD using evidence-based treatment and a needs-based  funding model;    Whereas school boards are expecting an influx of approximately 1,000  students with ASD as families lose funding for treatment services,  resulting in educators being tasked with providing care for children with  ASD without appropriate support or resources; and,     Whereas the funding model changes proposed by the Province will  result in thousands of families currently receiving behavioural therapy  seeing drastic cutbacks in funding for these services;    Now Therefore be it Resolved:  1. That the Council of The Corporation of the Town of Whitby  formally requests the Minister of Children, Community and Social  Services suspend implementation of the proposed funding model  changes and continue to identify and advocate for a sustainable  funding plan for individuals with ASD to ensure adequate  resources for Applied Behavioural Analysis and necessary  Page 12 of 15  Committee of the Whole Minutes   May 13, 2019 - 6:00 PM    therapies;  2. That the Minister of Children, Community and Social Services  work collaboratively with families, community partners and  stakeholders to develop a funding plan which will ensure that  every person with ASD has access to needs-based funding and  individualized programming;  3. That children and youth currently enrolled in specialized  programming continue to receive these services; and,  4. That a copy of this resolution be forwarded to Premier Ford,  Minister Fedeli, Minister MacLeod, MPP Lorne Coe, Region of  Durham Council, Chairs of the respective school boards in the  Region of Durham, and the Association of Municipalities of  Ontario.    Note: The disposition of the matter, Item 11.1, was determined  through the referral motion below.    Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Leahy    That the motion to the Province regarding changes to funding for Autism  Spectrum Disorder be referred to Staff to investigate opportunities that  the Town can support families and persons with autism through  municipal programs and services.    Carried    11.2 Seniors' Van Town Hall Meeting  Discussion ensued between Members of the Committee and Town Staff  regarding:  \u2022 the ability to amend the language used within the motion and to  remove the words town hall meeting and replace them with  information meeting;  \u2022 clarification on the purpose of the information meeting and  whether it would provide meaningful solutions;  \u2022 the ability for Staff to communicate with seniors and to help them  identify alternate transportation options to access the Seniors'  Centre;  \u2022 whether Staff could provide a memorandum to Council outlining  the content of the discussion and feedback received at the  information meeting;  \u2022 the timeline to conduct the information meeting and advancing it  Page 13 of 15  Committee of the Whole Minutes   May 13, 2019 - 6:00 PM    to June 2019; and,  \u2022 the timeline of any potential donation from Elexicon Energy to  support the operating costs of the Seniors' Van Service.      Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Shahid    That Staff be directed to hold a town hall meeting with members of the  Seniors' Centre to provide information regarding the discontinuation of  the Seniors' Van service at the end of August 2019 and alternative  transportation options to access the Seniors' Centre.

Mr. Wafer stated that with the continued  lock down measures and restrictions there would be a long road to  recovery ahead.

He advised that he and other  residents from Solmar Avenue have complained about vehicles  speeding to the Durham Regional Police Service over the years, noting  that there have been several near accidents with vehicles, bicycles, and  children playing. Mr. Parkins raised concerns about the increased risk of  accidents and the safety of children due the new public school  Page 5 of 25  Committee of the Whole Minutes   May 10, 2021 - 7:00 PM    scheduled to open in September 2021 and new residents moving into  the area. He requested that the program be expanded to include speed  humps on Solmar Avenue near the new public school.   A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Mr. Parkins regarding whether the traffic volume and  speed was due to vehicles accessing Solmar Avenue from Anderson  Street.      7.6  Lindsay Clegg  Re: Public Works Department Report, PW 18-21  Robert Attersley Drive East Speed Hump Pilot Project Status Update    Refer to Item 9.7, PW 18-21   Lindsay Clegg, 90 William Stephenson Drive, raised concerns about  excessive traffic speed in her neighbourhood. She stated that she was  in support of the Staff recommendation. Ms. Clegg stated that the Staff  report indicated that rubber based temporary speed humps, speed  cushions, and signage were installed at four locations in Whitby, noting  that there were reductions in vehicle operation speeds when speed  humps and cushions were present. She stated that William Stephenson  Drive shares many similarities and attributes with Robert Attersley Drive.  Ms. Clegg requested that consideration be given to expand the program  to include William Stephenson Drive due to stop sign non-compliance at  the intersection of William Stephenson Drive and Erickson Drive, the  length of William Stephenson Drive with only one stop sign, and the  density in the area of William Stephenson Drive. She advised that the  multi-use-path which runs the length of the hydro corridor and crosses at  William Stephenson Drive would be completed in the summer of 2021.  Ms. Clegg stated that she has witnessed a number of pedestrians that  have almost been hit by vehicles at this location, noting that completion  of the multi-use-path would result in increased pedestrian traffic. She  advised that a central bus stop was implemented for the 2020/2021  school year by Durham Transportation Services at the location of the  hydro corridor which resulted in approximately 50 children using this  location daily to get on and off the school buses. Ms. Clegg raised  concerns about the speed of vehicles during rush hour and the safety of  children gathering at this location. She requested that consideration be  given specifically to the stretch of road at the hydro corridor for inclusion  in the project.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Ms. Clegg regarding:  \u2022 whether William Stephenson Drive was used as by-pass for  Thickson Road and Anderson Street and whether the volume and  Page 6 of 25  Committee of the Whole Minutes   May 10, 2021 - 7:00 PM    speed of traffic on the street was due to the road being used as a  by-pass;   \u2022 whether there was a reduction in traffic volume and speed on the  street as a result of the Stay-at-Home Order;  \u2022 the peak times for traffic volume and speed on the street;  \u2022 whether vehicles stop or roll through the stop sign located at the  intersection of William Stephenson Drive and Erickson Drive and  accelerate quickly from the stop sign; and,  \u2022 the feedback received from residents on William Stephenson  Drive.      7.7  Stephen Foston  Re: Public Works Department Report, PW 18-21  Robert Attersley Drive East Speed Hump Pilot Project Status Update    Refer to Item 9.7, PW 18-21  Stephen Foster, 129 Halls Road, provided a PowerPoint presentation  regarding the Speed Hump Pilot Project. Highlights of the presentation  included:  \u2022 the installation of the Durham West Link GO Transit parking lot  and sidewalk on the east side of Halls Road in 2017;  \u2022 the increase in traffic volume and speed on the street;  \u2022 photographs of Halls Road facing south, Halls Road facing east  at the entrance to the Durham West Link GO Transit parking lot,  Halls Road facing north in 2018 following the installation of the  Durham West Link GO Transit parking lot, and the location on the  street used as a drag strip;  \u2022 detailed information about monthly discussions with the customer  relations representative from GO Transit;  \u2022 details about the portion of the road used as a drag strip;  \u2022 concerns previously raised about traffic speed, the safety of  children playing on the street, and requests for speed hump  installation;  \u2022 the impact of COVID-19 on traffic speed, racing, and traffic  volume;  \u2022 a request to expand the speed hump program to install speed  humps along Halls Road between the last house to the north,  southerly to the end of Halls Road.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Mr. Foston regarding:  \u2022 the results of police presence on the street and whether vehicles  were pulled over for speeding;  Page 7 of 25  Committee of the Whole Minutes   May 10, 2021 - 7:00 PM    \u2022 whether drag racing has taken place on Halls Road;  \u2022 whether mechanics from the Subaru dealership were test driving  vehicles on Halls Road;  \u2022 whether signage for the dead end was installed;  \u2022 the feedback from residents on Halls Road; and,  \u2022 whether continued requests for speed humps have been made to  the Town since 2017.      7.8  Mark Frayne  Re: Public Works Department Report, PW 18-21  Robert Attersley Drive East Speed Hump Pilot Project Status Update    Refer to Item 9.7, PW 18-21  Mark Frayne, 863 Bradley Drive, advised that Bradley Drive connects  Anderson Street and Garden Street and runs north and south between  Dundas Street and Manning Road. He further advised that Bradley  Street was used as a by-pass for Dundas Street and Garden Street. He  raised concerns about the increased traffic volume and speed along the  portion of Bradley Drive between Pringle Street and Garden Street,  noting that Bradley Drive was surrounded by schools and parks. Mr.  Frayne advised that over the years there has been a noticeable change  in the character of the neighbourhood, with many young families moving  onto side streets that use Bradley Drive exclusively as an access and  exit to their home street. Mr. Frayne noted that there were a couple of  recent medium density developments in the neighbourhood which  resulted in increased traffic volume and speed. He requested that the  program be expanded to include the implementation of traffic calming  measures on Bradley Drive.  A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Mr. Frayne regarding whether traffic volume and speed  had increased due to development in Whitby.      7.9  Romolo Raponi  Re: Public Works Department Report, PW 18-21  Robert Attersley Drive East Speed Hump Pilot Project Status Update    Refer to Item 9.7, PW 18-21  Mr. Raponi advised the Committee that Debbie Marotta would address  the Committee on behalf of residents on Powell Road with respect to  this matter.      Page 8 of 25  Committee of the Whole Minutes   May 10, 2021 - 7:00 PM    7.10 Debbie Marotta  Re: Public Works Department Report, PW 18-21  Robert Attersley Drive East Speed Hump Pilot Project Status Update    Refer to Item 9.7, PW 18-21  Debbie Marotta, 335 Powell Road, advised that she was representing  residents that live on Powell Road. She advised that Powell Road was a  long stretch of straight road that runs north from Hawkstone Crescent to  Highway 2, that it does not have any stop signs, and that the speed limit  was 50 km/hour. She raised concerns about the high rate of speed of  vehicles travelling on Powell Road, noting that residents would like to  see a reduction in speed on the street. Ms. Marotta stated that children  play on the street, that there was an increase in speeding on the street,  and that there has been police presence on the street to monitor traffic  speed. Ms. Marotta requested that if speed humps could not be installed  on Powell Road that three-way stop signs be installed at the  intersections of Broadview Avenue and Powell Road, Northview Avenue  and Powell Road, and Hunter Street and Powell Road.   A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Ms. Marotta regarding:  \u2022 whether the speed limit sign has been relocated on Powell Road  and whether residents were satisfied with its new location;  \u2022 whether the increased traffic and speed was due to Powell Road  being used as a by-pass for other streets; and,  \u2022 the primary areas of concern with respect to traffic speed on  Powell Road.      7.11 Lori Scott  Re: Public Works Department Report, PW 18-21  Robert Attersley Drive East Speed Hump Pilot Project Status Update    Refer to Item 9.7, PW 18-21  Lori Scott, 15 Whitburn Street, stated that she appreciated the work  undertaken to date to install speed humps on several streets in Whitby.  Ms. Scott advised that there was a public school located on Whitburn  Street, that the street connects Brock Street and Rossland Road, and  that the street was 1.3 kilometres in length with a hill. Ms. Scott advised  that there was .6 kilometres of wide, straight road on Whitburn Street  where drag racing occurs. She raised concerns about traffic speed and  drag racing on the street. Ms. Scott advised that there has been police  presence on the street, and that the street has been involved with Road  Watch. Ms. Scott inquired about the decision to only install one speed  Page 9 of 25  Committee of the Whole Minutes   May 10, 2021 - 7:00 PM    hump on the street, noting that speed humps need to be installed all the  way through to Rossland Road. She further inquired about the  location(s) where speed detection equipment was used, whether a study  was undertaken on the southern portion of Whitburn Street, and whether  one or two more speed humps could be installed. Ms. Scott stated that  at one time there was a temporary speed hump located near Rossland  Road. She advised that she was pleased to see some progress on the  street, but that she was concerned about the .6 kilometre stretch of  road.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Ms. Scott regarding:  \u2022 clarification on the location of the delegate's property relative to  Woodlands Avenue and whether it was located north or south of  Woodlands Avenue;  \u2022 how long vehicles have been drag racing along Whitburn Street;  and,  \u2022  whether there was consistency with respect to police presence  on the street.      7.12 Jacqueline Forrester  Re: Public Works Department Report, PW 18-21  Robert Attersley Drive East Speed Hump Pilot Project Status Update    Refer to Item 9.7, PW 18-21  Jacqueline Forrester, Resident, advised that she resides at the corner of  Bradley Drive and Wyndfield Crescent, and that her driveway was  located on Bradley Drive. She raised concerns about the traffic speed  on Bradley Drive, noting that Bradley Drive was being used by motorists  as a by-pass for Garden Street and Anderson Street. Ms. Forrester  stated that there was only one stop sign located at Pringle Drive which  was 800 metres in from the point of access onto Bradley Drive from  Garden Street. She stated that she has frequently witnessed vehicles  passing by her driveway at well over safe or acceptable speeds for a  residential road, noting that were four schools in close proximity to the  area. Ms. Forrester stated that the speed limit on Garden Street and  Bradley Drive were both 50 km/hour, noting that Bradley Drive was a  residential street and should not have a speed limit of 50 km/hour. She  advised of the police presence on Garden Street near Julie Payette  Public School, noting that dense residential areas where children live  and play with speed limits of 50 km/hour need to be protected. Ms.  Forrester advised that she had previously inquired about the installation  of a 3-way stop at Bradley Drive and Martinet Street, noting that the  traffic speed problem would only be worse once the pandemic was over.  Page 10 of 25  Committee of the Whole Minutes   May 10, 2021 - 7:00 PM    She requested the project be expanded in 2021 to include speed humps  on Bradley Drive between Garden Street and Pringle Drive since stop  signs were not a deterrent for speeding.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Ms. Forrester regarding:  \u2022 whether the traffic volume and speed have decreased with school  children learning online at home;  \u2022 whether the traffic volume and speed was consistent;  \u2022 confirmation that the street was being used as a by-pass;  \u2022 whether the areas of concern on Bradley Drive were between  Pringle Drive to Martinet Street or from Pringle Drive to Garden  Street; and,  \u2022 the feedback received by residents in the area.  It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 9.7, PW 18-21, at  this time.      7.13 Martin Field  Re: Legal and Enforcement Services Report, LS 07-21  Proposed Restrictions on Sales of Domestic Animals     Refer to Item 9.9, LS 07-21  Martin Field, 1134 Somerville Street, Oshawa stated he was Vice Chair  of the Oshawa Animal Care Advisory Committee. He advised that the  Ontario Municipal Act, 2001, S.O. 2001, c. 25 provides for lower tier  municipalities to enact by-laws that relate to animals and consumer  protection, and that a sourcing of animals by-law relates to three  important matters including animal welfare, consumer protection, and  public health including the spread of transmittable zoonotic diseases.  Mr. Field stated that puppies raised in puppy mills are subject to  appalling conditions and are often found with significant health and  behavioural issues. He noted that the Staff report referenced the City of  Oakville, but did not mention that the City of Oakville regulates the  sourcing of cats and dogs through their municipal licensing provisions.  He advised that 17 municipalities in Ontario have enacted similar by- laws. Mr. Field stated that a municipality that does not enact a by-law  would be opening the door to exploitive pet shops who prey upon local  residents. He noted that according to Humane Canada approximately 60  percent of residents were pet owners. Mr. Field advised that the City of  Oshawa acknowledged potential liability issues, noting that if a person  purchased a pet at a local pet shop that fell ill and they were  successfully compensated through small claims court, they could then  sue the municipality upon learning that the municipality had an  Page 11 of 25  Committee of the Whole Minutes   May 10, 2021 - 7:00 PM    opportunity to enact a sourcing of animals by-law, but failed to do so.  Mr. Field suggested that Staff review all Ontario municipalities for  examples of such municipal legislation. He stated that the Staff report  speaks to negative effects on local shops or businesses, and assured  the Committee there have not been any negative effects in Oshawa. He  further stated that negative effects could arise from not doing anything.  Mr. Field noted that a smart business owner was aware that operating  an ethical business would attract the trust and loyalty of customers, and  that in the case of a pet shop, their success depends on catering to the  life time of the pet rather than profiting from a single and questionable  pet sale. He advised that Humane Canada, the Humane Society of  Durham Region, the Ontario Veterinary Medical Association, and the  Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals all have  statements relating to discouraging the sale of cats and dogs in pet  shops. He commented on his difficulty understanding the assertion in  the Staff report that a by-law would encourage online sales when online  sales already exist. He requested that Staff prepare a report that  addresses enacting a regulatory and licensing by-law which focuses on  animal care, the training of pet shop staff, the implementation of a  provision that would regulate the sourcing of cats, dogs, and rabbits for  sale in pet shops, and that the report be presented to the Committee  before the end of 2021.   A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Mr. Field regarding whether he recommended the Town  of Whitby referencing the City of Oshawa's by-law.      7.14 Liz White representing Animal Alliance of Canada  Re: Re: Legal and Enforcement Services Report, LS 07-21  Proposed Restrictions on Sales of Domestic Animals    Refer to Item 9.9, LS 07-21  Liz White, representing Animal Alliance of Canada, 101-221 Broadview  Avenue, Toronto, advised that Animal Alliance of Canada was a  federally incorporated non-profit organization dedicated to the protection  of all animals and the environment. She stated that since 1990 they  have worked to end the retail sale of dogs and cats through pet shops,  replacing those animals with dogs and cats from animal shelters and  rescue groups. Ms. White suggested that Staff bring a by-law forward by  the end of 2021 that would ban the commercial sale of dogs, cats, and  rabbits within the Town of Whitby, except for those animals from animal  shelters, rescue agencies and humane societies. She advised that  shelters face challenges finding homes for the dogs and cats in their  care, and that dogs and cats were often euthanized by shelters due to  Page 12 of 25  Committee of the Whole Minutes   May 10, 2021 - 7:00 PM    limited cage space. She stated that this was also the case in municipal  pounds due to limited housing and an open admission policy which was  compounded by increased births of kittens and puppies in the spring,  summer and fall. Ms. White noted that an influx of unwanted animals at  shelters was likely to increase as the pandemic ends, people return to  work and can no longer care for the animals they acquired during the  pandemic.  She stated that shelters were often perceived as sad and  difficult places, and presented a barrier to people who might otherwise  provide loving homes to shelter animals. Ms. White advised that 17  municipalities in Ontario have passed by-laws regulating sales in pet  stores. She cited an IBIS World Industry Report # 45391 which indicated  that the sale of live animals was only a small portion of the overall pet  business in a pet store, so replacing a retail animal with a rescue animal  would maintain the retail relationship with the adopter by providing all  the supportive needs such as pet supplies, food and services. Ms. White  noted that making this change would not have an impact on pet store  revenues.      7.15 Gillian Lauder  Re: Legal and Enforcement Services Report, LS 07-21  Proposed Restrictions on Sales of Domestic Animals    Refer to Item 9.9, LS 07-21  Gillian Lauder, 28 Glen Lawrence Crescent, Kingston, stated that she  and Mr. Field had initially approached Town Staff for the purpose of  establishing a by-law to regulate the sourcing of cats, dogs and rabbits  for the sale in pet shops and other retail outlets who sell pets. She  advised that they had raised concerns about the commercial sale of pets  as a dog groomer business located in Whitby had sold pets for multiple  years. Ms. Lauder provided detailed information about her experiences  with the puppies at this location. She advised of an advertisement from  the same business on Facebook in 2019 with pictures of puppies that  would be arriving to the store in time for Christmas. She advised that  she was aware of various puppy mill operations in Ontario, and that the  initial reason for requesting the implementation of a pet sale by-law was  based on the living and breeding conditions found in commercial  kennels which were often referred to as puppy mills. Ms. Lauder stated  that puppy mills and back yard breeders were the cause of pet  overpopulation. She stated that the pet overpopulation was at epidemic  numbers and that local humane societies and rescue organizations were  at a breaking point in terms of resources. She advised of a report by the  Humane Society Veterinary Medical Association which detailed over  2500 puppy buyer complaints including the number of puppies that  suffered from illness, the number of puppies with congenital defects,  Page 13 of 25  Committee of the Whole Minutes   May 10, 2021 - 7:00 PM    and, the number of puppies that died. She advised that the report further  indicated that store owners often claim puppies were from small  breeders when they actually were brokers who buy their puppies from  puppy mills. Ms. Lauder stated that the customers who intentionally do  not want to support puppy mills were being deceived by pet stores. She  advised that when the City of Vaughan passed their by-law they did not  have any stores selling pets, but they recognized that as more  municipalities enacted similar by-laws that Vaughan would become  more attractive to potential pet store owners in the absence of a by-law.  Ms. Lauder suggested that Council consider that these animals that  were not spayed/neutered would be entering the community. She  requested that a comprehensive Staff report be brought back to  Committee in 2021 for a fair opportunity for all stakeholders to contribute  information.      7.16 Cindy Bennett representing Humane Society of Durham Region  Re: Re: Legal and Enforcement Services Report, LS 07-21  Proposed Restrictions on Sales of Domestic Animals    Refer to Item 9.9, LS 07-21  Cindy Bennett, representing Humane Society of Durham Region  (HSDR), advised that the HSDR supports the proposed restriction on  sales of domestic animals and the responsible sourcing of dogs, cats  and rabbits. Ms. Bennett advised that there have been puppy mills in  Durham Region. She provided details about the physical condition of  dogs from puppy mills upon their rescue. She advised that HSDR  rescued 110 dogs over a 3-week period from different puppy mills in  Durham Region. She noted that every dog was spayed or neutered for  free in vet clinics all over the Region of Durham, and that the dogs were  adopted. Ms. Bennett advised that HSDR staff, volunteers, donors, and  thousands of supporters care, and that HSDR staff were convinced that  the animals going into pet stores and other outlets were from puppy  mills. She noted that although the Town has only received one  complaint, HSDR has received complaints from the public and has  referred them appropriately. Ms. Bennett requested that the Town  consider passing a by-law similar to the City of Oshawa's by-law which  was supported by Humane Canada and the Ontario Society for the  Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.     A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Ms. Bennett regarding:  \u2022 the delegate's position on banning commercial and private pet  sales;  Page 14 of 25  Committee of the Whole Minutes   May 10, 2021 - 7:00 PM    \u2022 the qualifications for an organization to be designated a rescue;  and,  \u2022 differentiating between reputable breeders and puppy mills.  It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 9.9, LS 07-21, at  this time.    8.  Correspondence    8.1  There was no correspondence.    9.  Staff Reports    9.1  Financial Services Department and Legal and Enforcement Services  Joint Report, FS 14-21  Re: Abilities Centre Land Lease Agreement Amendment and Loan  Agreement  A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Staff regarding confirmation that the proposed loan  agreement with the Abilities Centre was similar to the Town's loan  agreement with the Whitby Football Club for the soccer dome  construction costs.      Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Mulcahy    1. That the Town of Whitby provide a long-term loan to the Abilities  Centre, to a maximum amount of $6,500,000 funded from the  Long-Term Finance Reserve;   2. That the Mayor and Clerk be authorized to sign a loan agreement  with the Abilities Centre attached as Schedule 1 of report FS 14- 21;  3. That the Mayor and Clerk be authorized to sign an amendment to  the Ground Lease Agreement to extend the term to 2051 (from  2030) and to reflect the loan agreement;  4. That the Treasurer and Town Solicitor be authorized to negotiate  and adjust conditions in the best interest of the Town of Whitby;  and,  5. That item MD-5476 be removed from the New and Unfinished  Business list.     Carried    Page 15 of 25  Committee of the Whole Minutes   May 10, 2021 - 7:00 PM    It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 7.2, Delegation by  Matthew Cory representing Brooklin North Landowners Group, at this  time.    9.2  Public Works Department and Financial Services Department Joint  Report, FS 16-21  Re: T-504-2021 \u2013 Pavement Routing and Crack Sealing  A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Staff regarding the longevity of crack sealing.      Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Mulcahy    1. That Tender T-504-2021 be awarded to Right Seal Inc., in the  amount of $78,764.00 (plus applicable taxes), for 2021 pavement  routing and crack sealing works, to be funded from the capital  projects listed in Table 2 of Report FS 16-21;  2. That the revised cost estimates, totaling $110,150.24 for the two  (2) capital projects noted in Table 2 of Report FS 16-21 be  approved;  3. That approval be granted to extend this contract for up to two (2)  additional one (1) year term(s) subject to budget approval and the  Contractor's successful performance of the previous term  including product quality and timely delivery; and,  4. That the Mayor and Clerk be authorized to execute the contract  documents.    Carried    9.3  Financial Services Department Report, FS 22-21  Re: 2020 Year End Operating Variances and 2021 Projection as at  March 31  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Staff regarding:  \u2022 whether a financial report to Council would be forthcoming  following the year end audit scheduled to take place in May 2021;  \u2022 whether the reduction of the investment revenues was related to  the previously approved long-term investment through the  Prudent Investor standard;  \u2022 clarification on whether there was a reduction in short-term  investment revenue and not long-term investment revenue;  Page 16 of 25  Committee of the Whole Minutes   May 10, 2021 - 7:00 PM    \u2022 confirmation on funds transferred to the Asset Management  Reserve Fund, the possibility that some of those funds may be  needed to offset potential losses for the remainder of 2021, and  whether the Asset Management Reserve Fund would have to be  used for future financial pressures related to COVID-19; and,  \u2022 whether there was uncertainty about the future COVID-19  pandemic costs, savings, and restarting programs to predict  financial projections for the end of 2021.      Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Leahy    That report No. FS 22-21 regarding the 2020 Year End Operating  Variances and 2021 Projection as at March 31 be received as  information.    Carried    9.4  Public Works Department and Financial Services Department Joint  Report, FS 24-21  Re: T-501-2021 \u2013 Urban Road Resurfacing  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Staff regarding:  \u2022 whether the Town has used Four Seasons Site Development Ltd.  in the past; and,  \u2022 whether the project would be delayed due to COVID-19.      Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Newman    1. That Tender T-501-2021 be awarded to Four Seasons Site  Development Ltd., in the amount of $2,176,154.50 (plus  applicable taxes), for 2021 urban road resurfacing works, to be  funded from the capital projects listed in Table 2 of Report FS 24- 21;   2. That the revised cost estimates, totaling $2,580,000.00 for the 13  capital projects noted in Table 2 of Report FS 24-21 be approved;  and,  3. That the Mayor and Clerk be authorized to execute the contract  documents.    Page 17 of 25  Committee of the Whole Minutes   May 10, 2021 - 7:00 PM    Carried    9.5  Financial Services Department Report, FS 28-21  Re: Development Charge By-law Final Recommendations [Revised]  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Staff regarding:  \u2022 the cost to the Town should the adoption of the proposed  Development Charge By-law be delayed by a month;  \u2022 whether the option to phase in the proposed development  charges was viable and the cost associated with a phased-in  approach;  \u2022 the possibility of accepting bonds versus letters of credit;   \u2022 opportunities for financial support for small commercial  development due to the proposed commercial development  charge rates, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on small  businesses;  \u2022 whether communication had taken place with stakeholders  requesting additional time to review the proposed Development  Charge By-law; and,  \u2022 deferring consideration of the Staff report until the Council  meeting on May 17, 2021.      Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Mulcahy    1. That based on submissions received regarding the February 19,  2021 Development Charge Background Study, it is  recommended that the revisions provided in Attachment 1,  Attachment 2 and Attachment 3 of report FS 28-21 be included in  the development charge calculations;  2. That Schedule B and Schedule C of the proposed by-law  included in Attachment 4 be amended to reflect the calculated  development charge rates outlined in Attachment 5 of report FS  28-21;  3. That the Town of Whitby Development Charge Background  Study, dated February 19, 2021 completed in accordance with  Section 10 of the Development Charges Act, 1997, and as  modified by the above recommendations, be adopted, including  the forecasts of development activity, the capital program and all  calculations contained therein;  4. That approval of the capital program, included in the Background  Study, as modified, indicates Council's intention that an increase  Page 18 of 25  Committee of the Whole Minutes   May 10, 2021 - 7:00 PM    in the need for service will be met as required under paragraph 3  of Section 5(1) of the Development Charges Act, 1997 and  Section 3 of Ontario Regulation 82/98. This approval shall be  subject to further annual review during the capital budget  process;  5.

The application is for permission to increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from  33% to 38%.  The subject property is located at 162 Fallingbrook Street and is zoned Residential  (R2A) within the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.   The requested variance is required to permit the construction of an accessory structure  (gazebo) within the rear yard of the subject property.   In Support of Application  Kurt Harfst  Carole Harfst  In Opposition of Application  None at this time.  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  K. Harfst and C. Harfst introduced themselves to the Committee as the owners of the  subject property.   K. Harfst advised the Committee of their proposal to construct a gazebo in the rear yard.  He noted that the maximum permitted lot coverage is 33%, but additional lot coverage is  required as the existing dwelling already occupies 33% of the lot coverage.   The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.   J. Cardwell referenced a roof overhang that covers the pool pump in the applicant's side  yard. He asked if this small structure was also factored into the lot coverage calculation.  C. Harfst was unaware if it was included within the coverage calculation.   J. Malfara was unable to confirm if this overhang was included in the lot coverage  calculation.   The Chair noted that the required lot coverage is approximately 37%, whereas 38% was  requested by the applicant.   J. Malfara agreed, and noted that there is a small buffer in the lot coverage.  B. O'Carroll asked if there are any sheds located in the rear yard.   Minutes of the 5th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment                           K. Harfst replied yes. He noted that the shed will be removed, as this is the location of  the proposed gazeebo.   The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that no public correspondence was received, and  there was no one registered to speak to the application.   The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.  Moved by: B. O'Carroll  That the application to increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 33% to 38%  located at 162 Fallingbrook Street be Granted subject to the following conditions:  1. That the site grading shall conform to the requirements of the Public Works  Department; and  2. Roof leaders from the proposed structure shall not spill onto the neighbouring  properties.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variance is  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.

The subject property is located at 18 Hillcourt Avenue and is zoned Second Density  Residential (R2) within the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.

D. Pearce introduced himself to the Committee as the applicant. He provided an  overview of the requested variances and noted that they meet the four Planning Act  tests. D. Pearce noted that the variances are required to permit the severance of the  property, similar to what has been done across the street from the property.   The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.   S. Haslam asked the applicant if the Land Division application was approved.   D. Pearce noted that the application was tabled pending the approval of an exemption  request from the Town of Whitby Interim Control By-law. He noted that an exemption  was granted by Whitby Council and the Land Division application is scheduled to be  heard on April 19, 2021.   The Chair asked J.

Minutes of the 5th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment                   Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/34/21  Cade McMannis on behalf of Girish Chandra  613 Henry Street  An application has been received from Cade McMannis on behalf of Girish Chandra, for  a variance from the provisions of By-law 2585.  The application is for permission to increase the total combined lot coverage of all  accessory structures on any residential lot from 50% of the lot coverage of the main  building on the lot to 99.6% (58.35 sq.m) of the lot coverage of the main building on the  lot.  The subject property is located at 613 Henry Street and is zoned Residential Type 2 \u2013  Downtown Zone (R2-DT) within the Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 2585.   The requested variance is required to permit the construction of an accessory structure  (detached garage) located within the rear yard of the subject property.   In Support of Application  Cade McMannis  In Opposition of Application  Cameron Craib  Cheryl Wallace  William Percy   Judy Rynbeek  Gary Smith  Peter Karagiannis  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.  C. McMannis introduced himself to the Committee as the representative of the property  owner. He noted that a two car detached garage is proposed within the rear yard of the  subject property. He also stated that the lot area is large, but the existing dwelling is  quite small.    The property does not have a garage currently, and the proposed structure will be used  to store the owner's personal vehicles.  C. McMannis also noted that the property is located within the Werden's Plan Heritage  Conservation District. A heritage permit has been approved for the proposed garage.   The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  S. Haslam asked if the existing shed in the rear yard will be removed.   C. McMannis was unaware if the existing shed will remain in place or be removed.   Minutes of the 5th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment       S. Haslam asked if the proposed garage will be used for personal use only.   C. McMannis replied yes. He confirmed that the garage will be used to park a truck and  recreational vehicles.  B. O'Carroll asked if the elevations and appearance of the garage has been approved  by the Heritage Committee.   C. McMannis replied yes.   The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J. Malfara advised the Committee that letters of objection were received. He noted that  these letters were circulated to the Committee for their viewing prior to the meeting.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.   C. Craib introduced himself as the owner of the neighboring property south east of the  subject property. He expressed concerns with an oversized fence that the applicant  erected around the perimeter of the property. He also noted that he often observes  large vehicles and trailers parked on the property, and wanted to ensure that a business  is not being operated out of the property.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee. There were none.   The Chair asked if there was anyone else wishing to speak to the application.  C. Wallace introduced herself to the Committee as the neighbor to the south of the  applicant's property. She expressed concerns with the recent fence the applicant  erected around the perimeter of the property. C. Wallace also noted that there is often a  large influx of vehicles parked at the property, and is concerned that this property will be  operated as a commercial property.   C. Wallace noted that she has no major concern with a smaller size garage if it's located  in line with the exiting dwelling.   The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee. There were none.   The Chair asked if there was anyone else wishing to speak to the application.  J. Rynbeek introduced herself as the owner of 617 Henry Street. She expressed  concerns with the size of the garage. She does not have an objection to having a  garage, but would like to see the proposal reduced in scale.  The Chair asked about the size of the garage.   C. McMannis replied that the garage is approximately 21 feet by 24 feet.   Minutes of the 5th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment       J. Malfara noted that the garage is suitable for two internal parking spaces, plus some  additional area for storage.   The Chair asked if there was anyone else wishing to speak to the application.  W. Percy introduced himself as the owner of 604 King Street, and expressed concerns  with the construction of the fence on the property, similar to what was previously  expressed by other members of the public. He is concerned that the By-law was not  respected during the fence construction, and this may be a similar situation when the  garage is constructed.   W. Percy also expressed concerns with the potential for a car repair business being  operated at the property and within the proposed garage.   The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee. There were none.   The Chair asked if there was anyone else wishing to speak to the application.  P. Karagiannis introduced himself as the owner of 610 King Street, which backs onto  the applicant's property. He noted that he also shares the same concerns raised by the  previous speakers.   P. Karagiannis provided three photos with the Committee of the applicant's fence. The  photos were taken from the rear yard of 610 King Street facing the applicant's property.   P. Karagiannis stated that the grading has been altered on the applicant's property and  noted additional concerns with the potential for a drive through garage, and the  applicant potentially parking vehicles and trailers in the rear yard.  P. Karagiannis concluded that the requested variance is not minor in nature and does  not meet the four tests as prescribed by the Planning Act.   The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee. There were none.   The Chair asked if there was anyone else wishing to speak to the application.  C. Wallace referred to a photo of the fence provided to the Committee illustrating the  grading change within the applicant's property. She noted that the applicant raised the  grade of their site, in turn covering the trunk bulb of a boundary tree located between  their properties.   The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee. There were none.   The Chair asked if there was anyone else wishing to speak to the application.  C. Craib recommended to the Committee that the fence should be removed prior to any  approvals being granted for the proposed garage.   The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.   Minutes of the 5th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment       S. Haslam asked if C. McMannis can provide input to the comments provided by the  members of the public.   C. McMannis advised the Committee that he was unaware of the fencing concerns. He  noted that the property owner is not conducting an automotive business on the property.  C. McMannis clarified that the trailers that were parked on the property included a  snowmobile trailer and a work trailer.   C. McMannis also noted that respect to the grading concerns raised, one of the  conditions of approval includes not directing roof leaders to adjacent properties and that  the grading is approved by the Town prior to construction.  C. McMannis noted that a drive through garage is proposed.   The Chair noted that the fencing issues and grading are unrelated to the proposed  garage and associated variance.   J. Taylor advised the Committee that there is a height restriction for fencing. He noted  that the Town of Whitby By-law Division is aware of the fencing concerns and is  investigating the matter.   J. Taylor also confirmed that on-site inspections will be required by Town Staff to ensure  compliance with the Ontario Building Code and that the garage conforms to the  approved plans.   J. Taylor concluded that if a homeowner alters their grading and it has impacts on  abutting properties, they may be held liable for damages, but this would be a civil mater  between the affected homeowners.   The Chair asked if the Committee can include a condition that would prevent the drive  through garage.   J. Taylor noted that these types of restrictions are not implemented, and it is important  that any imposed conditions would not impact what the Heritage Committee has already  approved.   The Chair asked who makes up the Heritage Committee.   J. Taylor stated that the Heritage Committee is a committee made up of appointed  members of the public, and also includes a Town of Whitby staff liaison.   The Chair asked if there was anyone else wishing to speak to the application.  G. Smith introduced himself to the Committee as the neighboring property owner to the  north of the subject property (415 St. John Street West). He stated that construction  vehicles have been continuously parked on the lawn of the property in the rear yard.  The Chair asked if there was anyone else wishing to speak to the application.  Minutes of the 5th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment                               P. Karagiannis had a question for C. McMannis. He asked why he did not originally  disclose that the garage will have a drive through bay.   The Chair interjected and noted that the purpose of this public meeting is not to  interrogate the applicant and/or their representatives.   The Chair asked if any members of the Committee were in a position to make a motion  on this application.   S. Haslam expressed that he would like to review the Heritage Committee approved  drawings before making a decision on this matter. He put forward a motion that the  application be tabled pending the review of the Heritage Committee approved drawings.   J. Malfara advised the Committee that he had the approved drawings available, and can  share them on the screen with the Committee and attendees. The drawings were  displayed for comments.   J. Malfara noted that the proposed building height is 3.91m, whereas the By-law permits  a maximum building height of 4.5m.   D. McCarroll asked what the size of the garage doors will be.   The Chair replied that they appear to be 7 feet tall by 8 feet wide.  Following the review of the drawings, S. Haslam withdrew his motion to table the  application.   Moved by: B. O'Carroll  That the application to increase the total combined lot coverage of all accessory  structures on any residential lot from 50% of the lot coverage of the main building on the  lot to 99.6% (58.35 sq.m) of the lot coverage of the main building on the lot located at  613 Henry Street be Granted subject to the following conditions:  1. Site grading shall conform to the requirements of the Public Works Department;  and  2. Roof leaders from the proposed structure shall not spill onto the neighbouring  properties.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variance is  minor in nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the  Official Plan is being maintained, and further that the granting of the  application is desirable and would result in the appropriate development of  the property.

The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.   D. McCarroll asked the applicant to provide an overview of the parking.   P. Slat replied that he has a double car wide driveway and a single car garage. A curb  cut permit was approved in 2010 for the driveway widening. He noted that only three  vehicles are located at the property.   B. O'Carroll asked if the garage is used for parking.   P. Slat replied that they currently park one vehicle on the driveway apron, as he has a  Seadoo in the garage. He noted that he will be transferring the Seadoo to a marina for  future storage, which will open the garage up for vehicle parking.   Minutes of the 5th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment                           B. O'Carroll asked where the entrance to the basement apartment will be located.   P. Slat noted that a new entrance to the basement will be constructed at the south face  of the dwelling.   The Chair asked J. Malfara, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  J.

Highlights  of the delegation included:  \u2022 opposition to the current proposal;   \u2022 the necessity for the alternate route, the lack of consultation with  Downtown Brooklin business owners, the unanswered questions,  and the lack of empirical data to support many claims;  \u2022 the Town's proposal to own Baldwin Street in the downtown core  in order to ensure a viable downtown, plan for future  development, reduce truck traffic through the downtown, and  improve pedestrian safety;  \u2022 Downtown Brooklin being unique and unarguably service based;  \u2022 models applied to retail based towns, such as Port Perry and  Unionville do not apply to Brooklin;  \u2022 the Town's vision for Downtown Brooklin not being not based on  the current or future reality of the downtown core;  \u2022 the knowledge of the proposal based on the location of residency  and not the location of the businesses;  \u2022 the lack of information received by downtown businesses to date;  Page 6 of 31  Committee of the Whole Minutes   October 25, 2021 - 7:00 PM    \u2022 a sampling of a dozen businesses indicated that 10 of 12  business owners were not aware of the Highway 7/12 Alternate  Route;  \u2022 the lack of support from businesses due to the cost of the project  and the Highway 7/12 Alternate Route running through the ORM;  \u2022 becoming a Member of the Brooklin Downtown Development  Steering Committee (BDDSC), in part, to represent Downtown  Brooklin businesses;  \u2022 informing all businesses and valuing their input;  \u2022 not meeting the requirement of consulting with affected  businesses by consulting with the BDDSC;  \u2022 the rationale for the alternate route was not striking a chord with  downtown businesses including Baldwin Street ownership  resulting in more road closures for parades and street festivals  resulting in the inability of clients to access buildings and forcing  businesses to close operations for the day;  \u2022 relocating events to take place at Grass Park, Luther Vipond  Arena, the Community Centre or one of the municipal parking  lots;  \u2022 unfulfilled requests for recent studies about reducing truck traffic  congestion in the downtown core;   \u2022 the dramatic reduction of truck traffic upon the completion of  Highways 407 and 412;  \u2022 the real traffic issue in Brooklin occurs east/west along  Winchester Road and not north/south on Highway 12;  \u2022 truck drivers bypass Brooklin using the existing network of roads  and truck traffic would ebb and flow with further development in  the area;  \u2022 the degree of the diversion of consumer traffic away from  Downtown Brooklin should an alternate route be constructed and  promoted, and how the diversion of traffic would be measured;  \u2022 paying high rent for businesses to have Baldwin Street exposure  and rationale for businesses wanting to pay such rents with an  inevitable decrease in the number of potential customers driving  by the businesses;  \u2022 the unfilled request for statistics to support the pedestrian safety  issue;  \u2022 the light pedestrian traffic in Brooklin's service based downtown;  \u2022 the Town's contemplation for an expenditure of quarter of a billion  dollars commanding the need for better dissemination of all  relevant information to downtown businesses and taxpayers in  general, a clear demonstration to downtown businesses about  the benefits of the project which should be followed with approval  from local business, and the need for studies with empirical data  Page 7 of 31  Committee of the Whole Minutes   October 25, 2021 - 7:00 PM    to surface or be initiated to validate many of the existing claims;  and,  \u2022 respecting the environment and the Oak Ridges Moraine  Conservation Act and removing all potential routes contained  within the ORM and the Greenbelt.   A brief question and answer period between Members of Committee  and Mr. MacCulloch regarding clarification on the studies requested and  whether the request for the recent Baldwin Street truck traffic studies  was sent to the consulting team.      7.4  Andrea Sorensen   Re: Public Works (Engineering) Department Report, PW 34-21  Highway 7/12 Alternate Route Environmental Assessment Status  Update      Refer to Item 9.1, PW 34-21  Andrea Sorenson, 9560 Mud Lake Road, provided a PowerPoint  presentation regarding the Highway 7/12 Alternate Routes. Highlights of  the presentation included:  \u2022 the impact of the alternative route B-R on her property and the  350-year old tree located in the rear of the property;  \u2022 the proposals were not optimized by focusing only on Whitby and  did not address a broader Durham Region growth strategy;  \u2022 Ajax, Oshawa, Pickering, Scugog all directly adjoin and were also  responsible for traffic in the Region;  \u2022 traffic issues that exist for neighbouring communities were not  considered;  \u2022 the significant impact on the environment including the wildlife,  the protected wetlands, the farm animals, the ground water for  rural north Whitby residents on wells, and the historical woods  and trees;  \u2022 the sub-optimal solutions that impact the ORM;  \u2022 the impact of using development charges for the project instead  of on other projects;  \u2022 the significant impact on the protected ORM, and other alternate  routes that could be considered without destroying the ORM; and,  \u2022 the diminishment of already dwindling farm land.      Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Lee    Page 8 of 31  Committee of the Whole Minutes   October 25, 2021 - 7:00 PM    That the rules of procedure be suspended to allow the delegation to  exceed the five minute speaking limit.    Carried    Ms. Sorenson continued her presentation regarding:   \u2022 the heavy focus on Brooklin while other surrounding areas of  Whitby are deprioritized.    7.5  Andrea Ferguson Jones   Re: Public Works (Engineering) Department Report, PW 34-21  Highway 7/12 Alternate Route Environmental Assessment Status  Update     Refer to Item 9.1, PW 34-21   Andrea Ferguson Jones, 585 Towline Road West, provided a  PowerPoint presentation. Highlights of the presentation included:  \u2022 the value of the Oak Ridges Moraine for its ecological importance  and as a critical source of clean drinking water;  \u2022 all alternative routes except Alternative A and Alternative B  including a stretch of Highway 7/12 which should terminate when  they rejoin Highway 7/12, and any improvements beyond the  point of an alternate route rejoining Highway 7/12 should not be  scored, and the rationale for Whitby to pay for upgrading existing  sections of Highway 7/12;  \u2022 Alternative A and Alternative B and any others that utilize  Townline Road should have been removed from consideration in  accordance with a Scugog Council Resolution;  \u2022 Alternative D and Alternative F totals approximately four  kilometers of extra costs and impacts considered during scoring  which artificially inflates the impacts these alternate routes would  have;  \u2022 the rationale for the consultant to continue with alternate routes  that cannot be implemented, and the waste of time and effort in a  project which has already exceeded its budget;  \u2022 concerns about scoring irregularities in the assessment of  alternatives including that two of the scoring factors related to  natural environment were for Protected Countryside outside of  the Oak Ridges Moraine which should have been scored together  as a single impact to the Greenbelt sub-factor, any scores for the  Oak Ridges Moraine were nullified by the score for Protected  Countryside;   Page 9 of 31  Committee of the Whole Minutes   October 25, 2021 - 7:00 PM    \u2022 scoring related to active transportation was incorrect for Townline  Road, Brawley Road and Myrtle Road as these roads were all  used by pedestrians and cyclists, however, the alternatives that  intersected or used these roads all had scores that suggested  little or no conflict with active transportation;  \u2022 the figures for scoring related to the properties impacted for the  Townline Road Alignment Alternatives indicate a significant  undercount of the number of properties impacted;  \u2022 requests for the scoring for Alternative A-R and Alternative B-R  without an acknowledgement of the requests several months ago  and now Alternative B-R without an acknowledgement of the  requests, and given the comparative nature of the scoring  process, the addition of two new alternatives should require the  re-scoring of all alternatives;  \u2022 the reference to the submission during the Open House 3  commenting period outlining other issues with scoring which  combined raise doubt about the validity of the results of the  scoring process;  \u2022 scoring to favour northern rural routes over southern more urban  routes  when alternate route F, with an already approved Mid- Block arterial road appeared to be the obvious alternative, but  scored poorly; and,  \u2022 Council's consideration that the preferred alternatives may have  been selected through a flawed process.   A question and answer period between Members of Committee and Ms.  Ferguson Jones regarding:  \u2022 whether scoring for Alternative A-R and Alternative B-R have  been received, and when the requests were made;  \u2022 details about the scoring factors that were not reasonable or did  not make sense; and,  \u2022 confirmation that the scoring flaws were related to the number of  properties and active transportation.      7.6  Steve Kee representing Brooklin Downtown Development Steering  Committee  Re: Public Works (Engineering) Department Report, PW 34-21  Highway 7/12 Alternate Route Environmental Assessment Status  Update     Refer to Item 9.1, PW 34-21   Steve Kee, 16 Tunney Place, stated that he was a resident of Brooklin  and the Chair of the Brooklin Downtown Development Steering  Committee. Highlights of the delegation included:  Page 10 of 31  Committee of the Whole Minutes   October 25, 2021 - 7:00 PM    \u2022 the future accelerated residential and commercial development  with a focus of the Committee on the vibrancy of Downtown  Whitby and Downtown Brooklin and making the downtowns  destinations, and gaining control of Downtown Brooklin to create  larger gatherings areas and better community events;  \u2022 the strategic objective of the Committee to make Brooklin more  livable by gaining control of Highway 12 north of Winchester  Road;  \u2022 the importance of considering all of the best possible route  options and undertaking further consultation, and gaining control  of the downtown;  \u2022 the role of the Committee to review, provide balanced input and  communicate information and results of decisions to the  community;   \u2022 the recommendation of the Committee to continue work on the  Environmental Assessment and to seek further options for the  project; and,  \u2022 supporting livability, fun, and community engagement in Brooklin.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Mr. Kee regarding;  \u2022 whether the community was opposed to the Highway 7/12  Alternate Route Environmental Assessment or whether there was  a lack of information;  \u2022 whether the community was aware of the purpose of the  Environmental Assessment;  \u2022 whether the community was engaged enough to know about the  alternate routes;  \u2022 whether dialogue and documents sent out to the businesses was  highlighted to the businesses; and,  \u2022 whether the delegate was in agreement that the Downtown  Brooklin community was aware of the Environmental  Assessment; and,  \u2022 whether the alternative route preference was the Mid-Block and  Thickson Road.      7.7  Stephen Jones   Re: Public Works (Engineering) Department Report, PW 34-21  Highway 7/12 Alternate Route Environmental Assessment Status  Update     Refer to Item 9.1, PW 34-21   Page 11 of 31  Committee of the Whole Minutes   October 25, 2021 - 7:00 PM    Stephen Jones, 585 Townline Road West, stated that he was a resident  of Townline Road and signatory of the July 30, 2021 submission to the  Town. Highlights of the delegation included:  \u2022 the lack of opportunity for members of the public to speak about  the project in an official capacity due to the COVID-19 pandemic;  \u2022 communication following the Community Open House # 2 about  the selection of Townline Road as the preferred alternative option  was via word of mouth and Facebook and not through the Town  of Whitby;  \u2022 that only after contacting/meeting with Members of Council  residents of Scugog and Whitby in the affected corridor received  notice via mail, and that the notice only showed the study area  and not the properties that would face expropriation;  \u2022 the exhibits, particularly the maps, provided at the Community  Open House # 3 were poor quality and missing information, and  the same map was included with the study on Connect Whitby;  \u2022 residents registered with email addresses were not notified when  documents were added during Community Open House # 3 and  the Interim Analysis and Evaluation Report which provides details  about the route scoring was only made available mid to end of  June 2021;  \u2022 the Interim Analysis and Evaluation Report on Connect Whitby  was only 69 pages of the original document containing 274  pages;  \u2022 details and concerns about the survey questions which appeared  to be designed to yield a desired result for the study group and  skews the results of the survey;  \u2022 the resolution passed by Scugog Council rejecting Alternative A  and Alternatives A-R, but the study group proceeded to present  Alternative A and Alternative A-R as the route alternatives at the  Community Open House # 3,  \u2022 the residents most impacted by the selection of \"A\", \"A-R\", and  \"B\" were predominantly on rural internet systems and have  difficulty participating in virtual meetings;  \u2022 the Community Open House summary released on Connect  Whitby had to be withdrawn due to inadequate redactions and  inaccurate information; and,  \u2022 justification for additional funding when the scope of the EA and  the extensive public consultation has not changed.  A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Mr. Jones regarding whether extended funding to further  to review the Mid-Block and Thickson Road alternate route was  something the delegate would support.    Page 12 of 31  Committee of the Whole Minutes   October 25, 2021 - 7:00 PM      7.8  Joseph Wyger   Re: Public Works (Engineering) Department Report, PW 34-21  Highway 7/12 Alternate Route Environmental Assessment Status  Update    Refer to Item 9.1, PW 34-21   Joseph Wyger, 546 Townline Road West, Scugog, stated that he was a  resident of Scugog and was speaking for his wife, himself and his  neighbours. Highlights of the delegation included:  \u2022 the lack of Whitby's jurisdiction to build a highway on a Scugog  road allowance without the consent of Scugog;  \u2022 the reasons for the enactment of the Oak Ridges Moraine Act;  \u2022 the inability to lawfully build a highway by-pass on the Natural  Linkage Area where the most newly preferred rail corridor route  was located, the requirements that would need to be satisfied,  and the misinterpretation of the Oak Ridges Moraine legislation  within the Staff report;  \u2022 the burden of the proponent to demonstrate that there was no  reasonable alternative other than to build a highway on a Natural  Linkage Area;  \u2022 the rationale for other alternate routes being so unreasonable that  the only solution would be to construct the east west portion of  the highway almost entirely on the Natural Linkage Area;  \u2022 the rationale for opposition to the preferred rail corridor route  including the project team ignoring the number one principle of  the Ministry of Transportation requirements to avoid Natural Core  Areas and Natural Linkage Areas, the societal need to preserve  the ORM exceeding the need for a Brooklin bypass, and the  numerous reasonable alternatives to the preferred ORM route;  \u2022 the Town's debate between the developers that do not want Mid- Block and Thickson Road alternate route and the residents that  reside between Columbus Road and the south edge of the ORM;  and,  \u2022 suggesting that Council direct Staff to remove of the ORM routes  from consideration, come up with a new preferred alternative  from the seven other alternatives and report back Council.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Mr. Wyger regarding:  \u2022 clarification on reasonable or unreasonable alternative routes;  \u2022 other analyses that would be considered more reasonable than  the interim analysis and evaluation report; and,  Page 13 of 31  Committee of the Whole Minutes   October 25, 2021 - 7:00 PM    \u2022 confirmation that applying high priority to environmental issues  over any other issues affects the reasonable alternative routes.      7.9  David Neligan   Re: Public Works (Engineering) Department Report, PW 34-21  Highway 7/12 Alternate Route Environmental Assessment Status  Update    Refer to Item 9.1, PW 34-21    David Neligan, Aird & Berlis LLP, 181 Bay Street, Toronto, advised that  he was representing concerned citizens who have participated in the  Highway 7/12 Alternate Route Environmental Assessment and have  raised concerns and questions, but have been dissatisfied with  responses received. Highlights of the delegation included:  \u2022 the submission of a letter to the Town from 160 citizens dated  July 30, 2021 outlining concerns about the ongoing  Environmental Assessment;  \u2022 residents not necessarily opposing an alternative route for  Highway 7/12, but some would be directly impacted by the route  alternatives;  \u2022 the prime objective to ensure that the proposed alternative route  steers clear of the ORM because that was what the law requires;  \u2022 the EA process and the preferred alternative do not satisfy the  legal requirements of the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan  (ORMCP);  \u2022 the ORMCP dictates that the development of infrastructure in or  on land in a Natural Linkage Area shall not be approved unless  both the need for the project has been demonstrated and there  were no reasonable alternatives;  \u2022 new infrastructure in the ORM may only be approved as a last  resort and not for a location that may be more convenient, higher  scoring or the most preferred alternative;  \u2022 the requirements of the ORMCP through the Provincial Class EA  process can be satisfied, but undertaking an EA does not absolve  the requirements of the municipality to adhere to the law;  \u2022 the necessity to strictly adhere to the EA process in order to rely  on the EA process as proof that all statutory requirements have  been fulfilled;  \u2022 the guidelines published by MTO on how to conduct and an EA in  the ORM set a high threshold for a proponent dealing with those  lands and identify an expectation that extra effort go into data  gathering, understanding the environment, the potential impacts  and avoidance of impacts of the project, and actions to mitigate  residual impacts;  Page 14 of 31  Committee of the Whole Minutes   October 25, 2021 - 7:00 PM    \u2022 the lack of evidence that any extra effort has gone into avoiding  the ORM with the preferred alternative or for identifying,  understanding or communicating the impacts;  \u2022 a review of all documents on the Connect Whitby site and  presentation materials at the Open House indicated that there  were no maps available to the public showing the proposed  alternate routes overlaid on the Greenbelt for the ORM land  designations, the final study design report did not mention of the  ORMCP or the legal requirements for building infrastructure on  the ORM, nor was it communicated in the Open House material;  \u2022 the only mention of statutory requirements came in response to  residents, and legal requirements surrounding the ORM were not  a priority in designing the study or in advancing a preferred  alternative which was contrary to class EA protocols and the  guidelines published by MTO;  \u2022 the work to fulfill the requirements does not appear to be  undertaken and/or it has not been communicated or made  transparent which was a failing of the process;  \u2022 the review of the process and materials indicates that the EA and  the preferred alternative route being advanced do not satisfy the  legal requirements, and if advanced, Council would be  susceptible to legal challenges in the courts or to refusal; and,  \u2022 the reconsideration of the preferred alternative, direction to  the  project team to review its work and prioritize the protection of the  ORM and the Greenbelt.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of Committee  and Mr. Neligan regarding:  \u2022 clarification on the legal requirements of the ORMCP for building  infrastructure on the ORM;   \u2022 whether there were reasonable alternatives presented and  included in the study and whether the preferred alternative was  not a last resort;  \u2022 whether some of the alternative options would fall within the  reasonable category; and,  \u2022 whether the delegate's position was that the EA process and  preferred alternative options did not meet the requirements of the  ORMCP or the MTO guidelines.      7.10 Wendy Evans representing Supporter of the Oak Ridges Moraine and  Greenbelt Community  Re: Public Works (Engineering) Department Report, PW 34-21  Highway 7/12 Alternate Route Environmental Assessment Status  Update    Page 15 of 31  Committee of the Whole Minutes   October 25, 2021 - 7:00 PM    Refer to Item 9.1, PW 34-21    Wendy Evans, 8195 Lake Ridge Road, advised that she has lived on  Lake Ridge Road for over 50 years, that she was one of the signatories  to the July 30, 2021 submission, and a strong supporter of the Oak  Ridges Moraine and Greenbelt. The highlights of the delegation  included:  \u2022 reference to a previous delegation regarding the rationale for the  opposition to the alternative route by Downtown Brooklin  business owners and the impact of road closures for parades and  street festivals on the businesses and clients;  \u2022 the rationale for the current proposed alternative endangering the  health of Downtown Brooklin businesses including directing  traffic, particularly out of Toronto, north on Lake Ridge Road and  through the ORM effectively moving potential customers outside  of the Brooklin primary and secondary trading area;  \u2022 the preferred alternate route proposes a bucolic ghost town  versus a thriving downtown;  \u2022 the growth of Brooklin over the past 10 years, the number of  businesses located on Baldwin Street, the percentage of  services, restaurants, and retail that thrive on the traffic and the  exposure from Baldwin Street, and the percentages of potential  business loss due to dependency on high traffic levels;  \u2022 a bypass typically results in big box stores locating at a junction  of two major roads, forming a strong retail node, and drawing  more traffic out of the downtown core accelerating the decline of  downtown;  \u2022 the existence of viable alternatives within an area that would  serve downtown businesses well and would be a far better choice  for the Downtown Brooklin business community and from an  environmental perspective;   \u2022 Alternative F, Mid-Block and Thickson Road would be located  approximately one kilometre east of Baldwin Street and in the  primary trading area;  \u2022 directing traffic out of the trading area would not solve a problem  that has little foundation, and redirecting traffic through the ORM  contravenes the existing ORMCP; and,  \u2022 the proposed route would jeopardize the clean water supply for 6  million Southern Ontario residents and the 250,000 people who  obtain their water supply directly from the ORM.  A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Staff regarding whether Thickson Road would be  considered too far outside of the primary trading area.      Page 16 of 31  Committee of the Whole Minutes   October 25, 2021 - 7:00 PM    7.11 Derrick Gleed  Re: Public Works (Engineering) Department Report, PW 34-21  Highway 7/12 Alternate Route Environmental Assessment Status  Update    Refer to Item 9.1, PW 34-21  Derrick Gleed, 19 Montery Court, advised he was not speaking on  current proposed alternate routes running through the ORM as the  previous delegates had conveyed their feelings about the current  recommended routes. Highlights of the delegation included;  \u2022 the support for an alternate route to bypass Downtown Brooklin,  but not a spend of $200,000,000.00 to route a highway through  the ORM;  \u2022 the budgeted amount of $87,000,000.00 in the current approved  Development Charges Study toward the new route representing  development over a 10-year period to 2031 leaving a shortfall of  $113,000,000.00 for the project, and the shortfall of funds  included in the subsequent DC Study to the year 2041;  \u2022 whether the road would not be built until 2041 or whether the  intention was to build it in less time with a need to debenture the  cost;  \u2022 developers not entering into a front end agreement for  infrastructure that was not within their build boundary and not  impactful on their projects;  \u2022 the cost for financing a debenture and whether the debenture  would impact the tax base should a debenture be the chosen  route;   \u2022 the potential assumption of debt that would also hamper the  borrowing capacity for other necessary projects such as the  Whitby Sports Complex;  \u2022 the assumption of revenue figures through development charges  studies based on projected market growth without a guarantee  that the budgeted amounts would be achieved in the time frame  allocated;  \u2022 the inability of the consultants to provide vital information and a  definitive response to residents about what constitutes the route  selection criteria; and,  \u2022 residents have repeatedly been informed that Alternative F which  would utilize the new Mid-Block and Thickson Road was  unacceptable;  \u2022 the merits of alternate route F (Mid-Block and Thickson Road)  including that Thickson Road was an Arterial Road A in the  Brooklin Transportation Master Plan and was designed to be a  major north south arterial thoroughfare with four lanes of traffic;  Page 17 of 31  Committee of the Whole Minutes   October 25, 2021 - 7:00 PM    \u2022 the design of Thickson Road as a Type A regional road was  reflective of provincial highway standards, i.e., minimal points of  entry all of which were signalized;  \u2022 the approved Brooklin Secondary Plan includes a provincially  approved interchange at its northern boundary so that traffic flow  would go straight through on Thickson Road the entire way with a  new turn off to Baldwin Street meaning that to access Downtown  Brooklin, trucks and all vehicles would have to turn onto Baldwin  Street instead of its current flow through;  \u2022 the reversal of the current Baldwin Street interchange would  resolve truck and traffic issues;  \u2022 the capital cost to upgrade Thickson Road to four lanes would be  covered by the Region of Durham and easily upgradable to  provincial standards through a Class EA; and,  \u2022 Highway 12 currently terminates 500 metres south of Highway  407 on Baldwin Street without any impediment to having Highway  12 terminate 500 metres south of Highway 407 on Thickson Road  which would put it in line with the Mid-Block which can assume  the Highway 7 role from Thickson Road to the intersection at  Winchester Road.      Recommendation:    Moved By Councillor Mulcahy    That the rules of procedure be suspended to allow the delegation to  exceed the five minute speaking limit.    Carried    Mr. Gleed continued his delegation regarding:   \u2022 the cost of the Mid-Block and Thickson Road route with the  financial responsibility of the Region of Durham to upgrade  Thickson Road to four lanes, and the budgeting of the Mid-Block  separately within the Development Charges Study on a front end  agreement with developers;    \u2022 any additional cost to upgrade the Mid-Block to provincial  standards could be assumed by the $87,000,000.00 budgeted for  the new route at no potential financial cost which would advance  the assumption of Baldwin Street;    \u2022 the notion that Thickson Road becoming the designated highway  would change the cultural make up of the community and the  reality that the growth of 85,000 people would alter the  community culture;   Page 18 of 31  Committee of the Whole Minutes   October 25, 2021 - 7:00 PM    \u2022 the lack of opposition to solving the current problem of Downtown  Brooklin and everyone supports the vision of ownership and  control of Baldwin Street; and,   \u2022 the request to take a step back, reassess the reality of a solution  that already exists, and move forward to make it work.     A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Mr. Gleed regarding whether the Mid-Block and  Thickson Road route would be the best option should it cost 30 to 40  percent more than other options.    7.12 Wayne Kluczynski   Re: Public Works (Engineering) Department Report, PW 34-21  Highway 7/12 Alternate Route Environmental Assessment Status  Update    Refer to Item 9.1, PW 34-21    Wayne Kluczynski, 9650 Heron Road, advised that he was a resident of  Whitby and a restaurateur for 35 years.

Highlights of the delegation included;  \u2022 the enormous amount of growth and development in Whitby over  the years, but none having such destructive and irresponsible  consequences as this project;  \u2022 the construction of a seven kilometre provincial highway through  the ORM for the sake for 500 metres in Brooklin;  \u2022 the ORM has an Environmental Protection Designation under the  Conservation Act, the ORM was a rain barrel for Southern  Ontario's water, and it was one of Ontario's most important  ecological areas with hydrologically sensitive features, important  groundwater recharge areas, woodlands, habitat for wildlife, fish  and other aquatic animals, and an area of prime farmland;  \u2022 the ORM was an important source of well water for north Whitby  and Scugog;  \u2022 the impact of the heavy construction of a provincial highway  through the ORM on the underlying water tables, aquifers and  streams and whether residents would be compensated for any  impact on their water supply;  \u2022 the difficulty for existing property owners to obtain a permit to  build as much as a new garage on the ORM;  \u2022 the impact on the ORM's water tables, Lynde Creek and natural  wildlife should hazardous loads be spilled, the amount of salt  required to maintain the road in winter washing into the water  tables, the potential delays in cutting through the ORM, and the  cost of expropriating properties and damage to existing  communities;  \u2022 concerns about heavy truck traffic, noise and air quality during  construction;  \u2022 the previous EA, at a cost of $2,000,000.00, undertaken by  Aecon Group Inc., a reputable Canadian company that has been  around for 150 years and has done work world wide, eliminated  the routes through the ORM due to its ecological significance;  \u2022 the better suited existing and/or proposed alternate routes that  are less costly, would not damage the ORM, and were currently  used by truck traffic around Brooklin, i.e., Lake Ridge Road to  Goodwood Drive and Thickson Road;  \u2022 the current truck traffic moving goods via Goodwood Drive which  connects to Hwy 7/12 and continues to Port Perry;  \u2022 the failure to plan and missed opportunities to create an area  other than on the highway to create a walking area where  suitable businesses that would benefit from it could establish  themselves;  Page 20 of 31  Committee of the Whole Minutes   October 25, 2021 - 7:00 PM    \u2022 keeping the solution to the problem in Brooklin within Brooklin;  \u2022 Alternative F would solve the traffic congestion on Winchester  Road;  \u2022 Thickson Road was purposed for a truck route, it was already  scheduled to be widened, and should be utilized which would  minimize the cost of the project without any destruction to  protected conservation lands;  \u2022 all three of the north alternate routes cut through the ORM and  cross entirely through the Natural Linkage Area and should be  completely eliminated as possible alternate routes; and,  \u2022 the request to Council to reconsider any decision to continue with  the current Highway 7/12 alternate route through the ORM.  It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 7.15, Delegation by  Michael Williams at this time.      7.14 Catherine Maugeri-Schuck  Re: Public Works (Engineering) Department Report, PW 34-21  Highway 7/12 Alternate Route Environmental Assessment Status  Update     Refer to Item 9.1, PW 34-21    When called upon, Ms. Maugeri-Schuck was not in attendance to make  a delegation to the Committee.

Highlights of the delegation  included:  \u2022 the agreement with a recent opinion column regarding Downtown  Brooklin and taking ownership of Baldwin Street;  \u2022 the 20-year old vision of Brooklin developing into a desirable  community to live in and to visit, but the current reality of Brooklin  being a sea of housing with limited options for dining or shopping;  Page 21 of 31  Committee of the Whole Minutes   October 25, 2021 - 7:00 PM    \u2022 the unnecessary presence of commercial motor vehicles and  heavy truck traffic significantly detracts from the quality and  safety of Downtown Brooklin;  \u2022 the need for the core of the community to be safely accessible by  pedestrians and cyclists;  \u2022 heavy trucks not having a place in a small community that caters  to pedestrians and cyclists who supportocal establishments;  \u2022 whether the desire was for Downtown Brooklin to be a highway or  a vibrant community that residents and visitors feel drawn to;  \u2022 the Durham Region's Vision Zero, Road Safety Action Plan  Emphasis Area 8 speaks to truck designated routes as a way to  reduce commercial motor vehicle collisions;  \u2022 a highway running through the core of the community places  residents at risk;  \u2022 children should not be walking or riding bicycles anywhere near  Baldwin Street;  \u2022 the steady stream of massive trucks passing by only metres away  while dining on patios in Downtown Brooklin;  \u2022 the type of environment people want to share with friends was not  the noisy, smelly, and unappealing atmosphere created by the  transport trucks sharing the same space;  \u2022 the solution to the problem in Brooklin was ownership of Baldwin  Street and continued efforts to divert heavy truck traffic from the  downtown area of Brooklin; and,  \u2022 improving the downtown area by making it safer and more  attractive to both residents and visitors while avoiding the  possibility of a ghost downtown.    A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Mr. Williams regarding whether the delegate would  support an alternate route such as Mid-Block and Thickson Road that  could potentially be more expensive and would have an impact the tax  base.
