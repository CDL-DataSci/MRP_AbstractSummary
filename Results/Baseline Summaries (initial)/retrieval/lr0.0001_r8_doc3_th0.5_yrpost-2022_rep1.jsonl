Mr. Sidler advised that the lot has not been  severed and the sign is inaccurate. He noted that there was a 1994  application to sever the property into three lots, however that application  was not approved, and ultimately the property was severed into two lots in  1996. He stated that his preference would be to have the severance       4  application considered prior to Council considering an Official Plan  Amendment and Zoning By-law Amendment.  Andrew Wood, Resident, appeared before Council and noted that he  attended the Land Division Committee meeting in 1996 that considered  severing 3 Cassels Road into three lots. Mr. Wood advised that at that  time, the Committee only granted approval to sever the property into two  lots.   A question and answer period ensued between Members of Council, Mr.  Sidler, and Mr. Wood regarding whether there were any conditions on the  title of 3 Cassels Road East that would prohibit the property from being  severed, and whether Mr. Sidler had an opportunity to review the  memorandum included with the meeting agenda from the Commissioner  of Legal and Enforcement Services/Town Solicitor and Commissioner of  Planning and Development.  6.2  Brayden Libawski representing 2738183 Ontario Inc.

A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of Council  and Mr. Libawski clarifying that there were no conditions from the 1996 lot  severance that would prevent consideration of a future severance  application, and confirmation that a lot severance would only be  considered by the Region on a conditional basis unless the applicant  secured an Official Plan Amendment and Zoning By-law Amendment in  advance.  7.

Declarations of Conflict of Interest  There were no declarations of conflict of interest.  3.  Appeal Hearing  3.1  Appeal of Order to Restrain a Dog  45 Bellwood Drive  Appeal # ASA 24-01  J. Bartlett, Animal Services Officer, provided an overview of what led to  the issuance of the Order to Restrain for 45 Bellwood Drive. Mr. Bartlett       2  stated that the incident occurred when a neighbour exited her house with  two dogs on a leash and one of the dogs, Yogi, slipped out of his harness  and ran towards the appellant and his dog, Roxie. He stated that the  interaction between Roxie and Yogi resulted in Yogi being bitten on her  neck and requiring medical attention by a veterinarian. He further stated  that an Order to Restrain was issued for Roxie to curb any negative  behaviour that may arise should another accidental situation occur. Mr.  Bartlett advised that complaints have been filed against the appellant for  allowing Roxie to run at large at a Town park since receiving the Order to  Restrain. Mr. Bartlett recommended that the Committee confirm the order.  A brief question and answer period ensued between the Committee and  Mr. Bartlett regarding:  \uf0b7 clarifying handwritten notes on the Order to Restrain;  \uf0b7 the distinction between the terms 'bitten' and 'interfered';  \uf0b7 whether complaints had been received about Roxie's temperament;  \uf0b7 details about handling future incidents and whether charges or  fines could be imposed against a dog owner;  \uf0b7 information about any previous Orders to Restrain against the  appellant's address; and,  \uf0b7 whether complaints had been received against Yogi prior to this  incident.  A. Sharma, the appellant, appeared before the Committee. Mr. Sharma  provided an overview of the temperament and training of his dog, Roxie.  Mr. Sharma stated that during the incident Roxie was in a sit-stay position  between his legs and only bit Yogi after Yogi nipped at her. Mr. Sharma  requested that the Order to Restrain be rescinded.  A brief question and answer period ensued between the Committee and  Mr. Sharma regarding:  \uf0b7 whether the appellant believed his dog bit Yogi; and,  \uf0b7 details about Roxie's dog training classes including where the  classes are held.  T. Lopez, a witness to the incident, appeared before the Committee. Ms.  Lopez stated that Yogi slipped his harness and ran towards the appellant  and Roxie, but Roxie was not in a sit-stay position and was pulling on the       3  leash towards Yogi. She stated that Roxie lunged at Yogi and bit her. She  advised that she took Yogi to a veterinarian who determined that Yogi had  suffered a superficial bite wound.  The Committee excused the witness, appellant, K. Novia, and J. Bartlett  from the virtual meeting at 2:41 p.m. and reviewed the matter. The  witness, appellant, K. Novia, and J.

{"text": "Minutes of the 11th Meeting    Committee of Adjustment    Meeting Date:   Thursday August 17, 2023  Meeting Time:  7:00 p.m.  Meeting Location:  Virtual Meeting    Present:  N. Chornobay, Chair   J. Cardwell  K. Docherty  S. Haslam  J. Rinella  R. Chow, Secretary-Treasurer  J. Taylor, Senior Manager, Zoning & Regulation  J. Malfara, Planner II, Policy Planning         Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   Item 1:  Disclosure of Interest:  There was no disclosure of interest by the members of the Committee of Adjustment  Carried  Item 2:  Public Hearings  A/40/23  Uthayan Annalingham  2 Franklin Crescent  An application has been received from Uthayan Annalingham for a variance from the  provisions of Town of Whitby Zoning By-Law 1784.  The application is for permission to increase the maximum permitted building height  from 8.0 m to 10.0 m.  The requested variance is required to permit a proposed single detached dwelling on  the subject property.  The subject property is located at 2 Franklin Crescent and is zoned Residential Estate  (RE).  In Support of Application:     Phil Lamadeleine (Owner Representative)    In Opposition of Application:    None at this time.   The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.   P. Lamadeleine introduced himself as the owner of Custom CADD, the company hired  by the homeowner to design the home. He provided an overview of the proposal and  explained the need for a variance. He also noted that as part of the subdivision  agreement, the proposal has gone through architectural control.   The Chair asked for confirmation on how the height of the dwelling was calculated.   P. Lamadeleine responded that the height measurement was taken at the midpoint of  the roof. He then explained that the height variance is needed to ensure desirable  proportions of the dwelling, and that visually appealing proportions was a guideline  given through the architectural control process for dwellings in this neighbourhood.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.    Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   J. Cardwell asked R. Chow if any developments nearby will have similar height  restrictions.   R. Chow stated that more minor variance applications may be expected for this  neighbourhood as the height provisions for this area are low due to the age of the By- law.  J. Taylor elaborated that the By-law is dated and that similar variances have been  successfully granted in a Residential Estate zone on Brawley Road, where numerous  applicants required relief from the By-law's height provisions to be permitted to build  dwellings taller than a bungalow.   There were no further questions from the Committee.  The Chair asked R. Chow, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  R. Chow advised the Committee that no correspondence was received.   The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.  Moved by: K. Docherty   That the application to increase the maximum permitted building height from 8.0 m to  10.0 m located at 2 Franklin Crescent be Granted subject to the following conditions:  1. That the site grading and services shall conform to the requirements of the  Engineering Services department.  2. That architectural review and approval is obtained prior to the issuance of a building  permit.  Carried  Reason:    The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variance is minor in nature;  that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the Official Plan is being  maintained, and further that the granting of the application is desirable and would result  in the appropriate development of the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.       Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   A/41/23  Thipeekaa Arumairajah  19 Lacroix Court   An application has been received from Thipeekaa Arumairajah for a variance from the  provisions of Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  The application is for permission to reduce the minimum required length of a driveway  parking space from 5.8 m to 5.3 m.   The requested variance is required to permit an accessory apartment.   The subject property is located at 19 Lacroix Court and is zoned (R2C*).  In Support of Application:   Thipeekaa Arumairajah (Owner and applicant)            Thileepan Yoganathan (Owner representative)  In Opposition of Application:   None at this time.   The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.   T. Yoganathan introduced himself, provided an overview of the proposal, and explained  the need for a variance.    The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.   S. Haslam asked for clarification on the comments written in the cover letter from the  property owner. He asked if the homeowner was aware that vehicles must be parked  within the lot lines of the property and if they are aware that vehicles are not permitted  to encroach on the municipally owned portion of the driveway.  T. Yoganathan responded yes.  J. Taylor provided more detail on the proposal. He explained that the existing driveway  parking space is shorter in length than what the By-law requires as it was built to  conform to past By-law provisions in effect at the time of the dwelling's construction. He  then explained that the proposed additional driveway parking space will be shorter than  what the By-law requires at 5.3 m, but still adequate.  The Chair asked J. Taylor if the proposed additional parking space would be completely  within the property.   J. Taylor responded yes. He elaborated that the proposed additional parking space  would only be shorter than the By-law requirements for a portion of the space due to the  curvature of the lot line.   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   The Chair asked if a vehicle could still fit in this proposed parking space despite the  reduced size.   J. Cardwell asked what type of vehicle the applicant would park in that space.   T. Yoganathan responded that it would be a normal passenger car, not a big truck or  SUV.  R. Chow stated that a larger vehicle such as the Ford F-150 measures 5.3 m in length  so the average passenger vehicle would be able to fit in the proposed parking space.  K. Docherty asked J. Taylor if the Planning Department was in support of the proposal.   J. Taylor responded yes. He elaborated that similar variances have been approved.  K. Docherty asked if the dwelling has a single-car garage.  T. Yoganathan responded yes.   T. Arumairajah stated that the current residents of the dwelling only own one vehicle. If  new residents are to live in the proposed accessory apartment, 2 of the 3 parking  spaces to be provided on the property would be available to them.   The Chair asked R. Chow, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  R. Chow advised the Committee that no correspondence was received.   The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.   Ruby Burrell presented herself as the neighbour of 19 Lacroix Court. R. Burwell asked  for an explanation of the proposal.  The Chair explained the proposal.  R. Burwell asked how the extra parking space would be provided.  The Chair explained that the parking space is already there but that it is not in  conformity with the By-law provisions for minimum parking space dimensions.  R. Burwell asked if any additions would be made to the dwelling.  The Chair responded no.   R. Burwell asked if the variance only deals with the parking space.  The Chair responded yes.   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   R. Burwell asked if any changes would be made to the contour of the street.   J. Taylor responded no.  R. Burwell asked where the parking space will be located.  The Chair responded that the additional parking space is on the driveway.  R. Burwell asked if the parking space would encroach on any adjacent property.  The Chair responded no.  R. Burwell asked if the applicant seeks to widen their driveway.  The Chair responded that the application is to approve the additional parking space.  K. Docherty asked if such a variance is commonly requested to have three parking  spaces.  J. Taylor responded that the applicant is seeking the variance to permit the undersized  parking spaces as the applicant requires 3 spaces on their property in order to permit an  accessory apartment.   There were no further questions from the Committee.  Moved by: J. Cardwell.   That the application to reduce the minimum required length of a driveway parking space  from 5.8 m to 5.3 m located at 19 Lacroix Court be Granted subject to the following  conditions:  1. That the site grading shall conform to the requirements of the Engineering Services  department.  2. That a minimum 1m setback is required between the edge of the driveway and the  streetlight pole in the boulevard.  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variance is minor in nature;  that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the Official Plan is being  maintained, and further that the granting of the application is desirable and would result  in the appropriate development of the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   A/42/23  Tracy and Eirik Mamoniw  605 Euclid Street  An application has been received from Tracy and Eirik Mamoniw for variances from the  provisions of Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 2585.  The application is for permission to (1) allow a home-based business within an existing  accessory structure, and (2) to allow the occupant to employ one employee who is not  an occupant of the dwelling.  The requested variances are required to permit a home-based business to operate from  the existing accessory structure on the subject property.  The subject property is located at 605 Euclid Street and is zoned Residential Type 3  (R3).  In Support of Application:   Tracy Mamoniw (Applicant)            Eirik Mamoniw (Applicant)  In Opposition of Application   None at this time.   The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.   T. Mamoniw introduced herself to the Committee and provided an overview of the  history of her ownership of the property and her home-based business, and her need for  the variances. She explained that her property has a bungalow plus an accessory  structure which was built by a previous owner. She converted the accessory structure  into a living space where she began home-schooling her children followed by the  operation of school-age daycare-type programs and activities for other children. She  learned that the accessory structure was only permitted to be used for storage, so she  requires variances to permit her home-based business.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  J. Cardwell asked if there are washroom facilities.  T. Mamoniw responded that the accessory structure has no running water but that the  main dwelling has washroom facilities that can be used for the home-based business.  E. Mamoniw added that washroom facilities may be added to the accessory structure in  the future.  K. Docherty asked J. Taylor if granting the requested variances will permit any type of  home-based business to operate on the property in the future, or if the variances will  limit the property to a specific type of business.    Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   J. Taylor explained that a daycare is currently permitted as a home-based business in a  main dwelling, but not in an accessory structure, so a successful variance is needed. He  further explained that the By-law has limitations overall to what anyone can do for their  home-based business and those limitations will still apply to any home-based business  in the applicants' accessory structure if the variance is granted.   K. Docherty asked if the Planning Department has any objections to the proposal.  J. Taylor responded that the Planning Department will be re-evaluating home-based  business By-law provisions as there has been an increase in requests for home-based  businesses in accessory structures and the By-law has older provisions.   K. Docherty asked the applicants if they had measures in place so that parents dropping  off their children at the home-based business would not be disruptive to the  neighbourhood.   T. Mamoniw responded that her driveway has ample space to accommodate vehicles at  drop-off times, that her husband is not home during business hours therefore his vehicle  does not occupy driveway space in the daytime, and that some of her neighbours have  told her that their driveways can also be used for parking when parents are dropping off  their children.   There were no further questions from the Committee.  The Chair asked R. Chow, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  R. Chow responded that 3 phone calls were received in support of the application and 1  email was received in opposition of the application, and that information on the  correspondence was forwarded to the Committee members at an earlier date for their  review.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application. There was no one.  Moved by: J. Rinella.   That the application to (1) allow a home-based business within an existing accessory  structure, and (2) to allow the occupant to employ one employee who is not an occupant  of the dwelling located at 605 Euclid St be Granted subject to the following conditions:  1. That except for a home daycare, no more than three persons at any one time shall be  present at any home-based business in the existing accessory structure to receive  teaching and/or instruction;  2. That no more than two persons at any one time shall be present at any home-based  business in the existing accessory structure to receive client-based treatment or  services;   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   3. That a minimum of three parking spaces be provided on the property in accordance  with the Zoning By-law (this condition only applies to Variance #2 to permit one non- occupant employee).  Carried  Reason:  The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variances are minor in  nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the Official Plan is being  maintained, and further that the granting of the application is desirable and would result  in the appropriate development of the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.   A/44/23  Mohammad Ghofrani   79 Barkerville Drive  An application has been received from Mohammad Ghofrani on behalf of Abdul Khan  for a variance from the provisions of Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  The application is for permission to reduce the interior side yard setback to a below  grade access stairway from 0.6 m to 0.23 m.   The requested variance is required to permit below grade access stairs within the south  interior side yard of the subject property.  The subject property is located at 79 Barkerville Drive and is zoned Low Density  Residential (LD).  In Support of Application:    None at this time.   In Opposition of Application:   None at this time.   The Chair asked if the applicant was present.   The applicant was not present to speak.   S. Hussaini presented himself as the neighbour of 79 Barkerville Drive.   The Chair stated that the meeting could continue without the applicant but that the  Committee would not be able to ask any potential questions to the applicant without  them present.  S. Haslam recommended that the Chair introduce the application and allow the  neighbour to speak, then see if the application should be tabled.  The Chair introduced the application and asked if the applicant was now present.   The applicant was not present to speak.  The Chair asked R. Chow, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  R. Chow advised the Committee that no correspondence was received.   The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.   S. Hussaini introduced himself as a resident of 81 Barkerville Drive and the neighbour of  79 Barkerville Drive. S. Hussaini stated that his side yard abuts the side yard of 79  Barkerville Drive and there is no fence dividing the lots. He asked if the proposal for  below grade access stairs as well as construction work to build the proposal would   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   encroach into his property. He also asked if any grading work would go beyond the  property limits of 79 Barkerville Drive.   J. Taylor stated that in order for the applicant to obtain a building permit, the Town of  Whitby Building and Engineering divisions would have to review the project first,  including any issues and work regarding grading and drainage. He also stated that all  works will have to be contained within the subject property.   The Chair asked for clarification on the drainage situation.  J. Cardwell stated that water is anticipated to drain to the bottom of the stairs and a  drain will be required.  S. Haslam asked if the 23 cm setback was measured up to the edge of the footing or up  to the wall of the proposed stairs. He expressed concern that if the measurement was  up to the edge of the wall, then the stairs would encroach into the abutting property.  J. Taylor stated the measurement was taken up to the edge of the footing.  S. Haslam asked if weeping tiles would be used for water drainage.   J. Taylor responded that the Engineering Department would determine what would be  required for drainage.  K. Docherty stated her concern for any potential effects of the proposed stairs on the  adjacent property, including the adjacent dwelling's foundation.  J. Taylor responded that there is a setback between the adjacent dwelling and the  property line as well.   The Chair asked how equipment such as a lawnmower would be able to be transported  into the rear yard.  S. Hussaini stated that the wider side yard is proposed to be occupied by the below  grade access stairs and that the side yard on the other side of the property is narrower.  J. Taylor stated that it should be noted that the lot line is not straight and that while the  side yard setback from the stairs would be 0.23 m at its narrowest point, the setback  would gradually increase to 0.5 m at the west side of the stairs.   K. Docherty asked what rights S. Hussaini would have if the Town's Engineering  department approved the proposal and, in the future, the project were to negatively  impact S. Hussaini's property.  J. Taylor stated that the building permit would be issued by the Engineering Department  with various requirements for grading and drainage. As long as the proposal is built in  accordance with the drawings approved from the Engineering Department, negative  impacts should not occur to the adjacent property.    Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   J. Cardwell expressed his concern for the setback distance of the proposed stairs and  his concern for the design of the stairs.  J. Taylor stated that the building department has the ability to ask the applicant to  rebuild the stairs if they are not built to their satisfaction.   K. Docherty asked if the basement entrance could be located at the rear of the dwelling  rather than in the side yard.  J. Taylor stated that alternative designs were discussed, however, the side entrance  option was chosen.   The Chair asked if there were further questions or concerns from S. Hussaini.  There were no further comments.  The Chair asked R. Chow, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  R. Chow advised the Committee that no correspondence was received.  Moved by: S. Haslam.   That the application to reduce the interior side yard setback to a below grade access  stairway from 0.6 m to 0.23 m located at 79 Barkerville Dr be Tabled.   Not carried  Reason:  A. Khan, the owner of 79 Barkerville Drive, entered the meeting. An opportunity was  presented for him to speak.   A. Khan asked if the Committee could wait for his representative and engineer, M.  Ghofrani, to join the meeting.  The Chair responded yes.  M. Ghofrani joined the meeting.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  S. Haslam asked how excavation for the stairs would avoid touching the adjacent  property.  M. Ghofrani responded that the project would not encroach on the neighbour's property.  S. Haslam and the Chair asked for an explanation of how that would be done.   Minutes of the 11th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   M. Ghofrani responded that forming and vertical excavation could be used.  S. Haslam asked if a vertical retaining wall would be used because vertical excavation  is illegal.  M. Ghofrani stated that there would be support to the vertical excavation to ensure that  the excavation is permitted.  J. Cardwell and S. Haslam expressed their concern for the construction methods  proposed.  K. Docherty asked how much space would be maintained in the side yard for any  service easements that may exist.  M. Ghofrani explained that soil can be stabilized with temporary supports, followed by  work on the footing, followed by backfilling. He then stated that only a portion of the  proposed stairs has a 0.23 m side yard setback.  The Chair reiterated the concern of the Committee to M. Ghofrani about executing  construction work in a tight space without encroaching on the neighbouring property.  The Chair stated that he believes the stairs would be at least 6 feet deep.  M. Ghofrani said yes, the stairs would be at least 6 feet deep.  S. Haslam stated that the side of the trench would have to be angled back for safety. He  asked how that would be done.  M. Ghofrani responded that cantilevered footing could be used and that a 0.23 m  setback only exists at one portion of the proposed stairs, with more space available  elsewhere.  The Chair asked M. Ghofrani how drainage would be addressed.  M. Ghofrani replied that a pipe could be provided for drainage and run-off water at the  top of the retaining wall.  There were no further questions from the Committee.  Moved by: S. Haslam.  That the application to reduce the interior side yard setback to a below grade access  stairway from 0.6 m to 0.23 m located at 79 Barkerville Drive be Tabled until after Town  of Whitby staff have further discussion with the applicant to revise their proposal and/or  provide further details on the construction process for the below grade access stairs,  and after residents are adequately notified of any potential changes to the proposal.

Carried  Item 4:  Other Business  There were no items raised under other business.   Item 5:  Adjournment  Moved by:  J. Cardwell  That this meeting of the Committee of Adjustment be adjourned.

He advised that he was eager to get to the detail design  phase to continue to work together on those details. Mr. Cory  stated that he believed it was appropriate, timely, and necessary for  the Draft Plan of Subdivision approval at this time to continue to  move forward.     Mr. Marchio stated that it has been a long 2 years and that he was  eager to move forward to the next step in the process. He advised  that it has been over 10 years since Lakeview Homes has  developed a community and constructed homes in Whitby.

(Lakeview Homes Inc.),  Northeast Corner of Ashburn Road and Columbus Road West, File  Numbers: DEV-27-20 (SW-2020-06, Z-14-20)    Refer to Item 5.4.1, PDP 01-23  Eugene Gmitrowicz, Resident, stated that he has been a resident,  homeowner, and taxpayer in Whitby for over 60 years, noting that  he has resided on Ashburn Road for the past 33 years. Mr.  Gmitrowicz advised that he sold 5 acres of his property to Lakeview  Homes a number of years ago, and that he retained 5 acres to live  out the remainder of his life. He stated that he designed and  constructed his home and was enjoying his 5 acres of land. Mr.  Gmitrowicz stated that he was approached by Lakeview Homes  and was told that if he did not sell his property there would be a lot  of noise, that the developer would build around his property, and  that his lot would be purposeless. Mr. Gmitrowicz advised that the  plan indicates that a road would be constructed through the apple  orchard on his property. He indicated that he would like the road to  be constructed around his property, noting that the road could not  be constructed on his property without his permission. He indicated  that the road could be built around his property by using a portion of  the park land. Mr. Gmitrowicz stated that he has planted a lot of  trees, noting that they would be the only trees in the area due to the  proposed development. Mr. Gmitrowicz stated that 40 percent of  the land purchased by Lakeview Homes 4 years ago was not  environmentally suitable for building and that no action has taken  place on the land. He stated that the land could be used to create a  park, noting that existing trees could be transplanted into a future  park. Mr. Gmitrowicz raised concerns about the partially torn down  building and the burdock that was growing on approximately 2  acres of land, noting that the area was an eyesore. He advised that  his dogs were finding dead birds caused by the burdock. Mr.  Gmitrowicz submitted photographs of the burdock and the  proposed road through his property.       5  5.2.4 Max Lysyk, 1628755 Ontario Limited, and Jeff Ormonde, Urbantech  Consulting (In-Person Attendance)  Re: PDP 01-23, Planning and Development (Planning Services)  Department Report  Draft Plan of Subdivision and Zoning By-law Amendment  Applications, 2068681 Ontario Inc. (Lakeview Homes Inc.),  Northeast Corner of Ashburn Road and Columbus Road West, File  Numbers: DEV-27-20 (SW-2020-06, Z-14-20)    Refer to Item 5.4.1, PDP 01-23  Max Lysyk, 1628755 Ontario Limited, and Jeff Ormonde,  Urbantech, stated that they were representing the owners of 320  and 360 Columbus Road West located east of the subject property.  Mr. Lysyk stated that his family has owned the property since the  1960's. Mr. Lysyk noted that applications for a Draft Plan of  Subdivision and a Zoning By-law Amendment were submitted to  the Town for his properties in July 2022. He stated that either he,  another family member or his planning consultant have appeared  before Council at previous Town meetings regarding concerns  about the proposed Lakeview Homes development. Mr. Lysyk  stated that he was not opposed to development, but that he was  opposed to development that adversely impacts his property. He  referenced an email that he sent to Members of Council in  November 2022 which provided information about his application,  and the boundary grading issues between the applicant and his  property. Mr. Lysyk advised that he was not in support of the Staff  recommendation contained within Report PDP 01-23. He stated  that approval of the proposal as presented at this meeting would  adversely impact the welfare of the present and future land use of  his family's property. Mr. Lysyk referenced correspondence  submitted to the Town dated November 22, 2022. He advised that  Lakeview Homes and the Lysyk family have not come to a mutually  agreed upon road centre line and boundary grade along the future  north Brooklin east/west collector road that spans between the two  properties. He stated that the applicant's proposal was to fill over 5  metres or 16.5 feet higher than the existing ground elevation at the  shared property line. Mr. Lysyk advised that he believed that the  proposed Lakeview Homes grading plan creates construction  challenges on his property and would result in future maintenance       6  costs to the Town and homeowners which could and should be  avoided if possible. Mr. Lysyk further advised that in November  2022 a virtual meeting took place between Town Staff, the  applicants consulting team and his consulting team, noting that his  correspondence to Council included a detailed description of the  meeting. He stated that the Commissioner of Planning and  Development requested that both parties reinitiate conversations to  work together to come to a mutually agreed solution to avoid delays  or appeals on both applications, and offered that Town Staff would  be available, if needed, to mediate a solution. Mr. Lysyk further  stated that Town Staff agreed to allow exemptions to the Town's  design standards to assist in resolving the matter. He advised that  following the November 2022 meeting he had spoken with the  applicant, noting that they agreed to allow both engineers to meet  to find a resolution. Mr. Lysyk stated that the meeting was not  scheduled to take place until Friday, January 27, 2023. He  indicated that until this meeting occurs, the approval of the Draft  Plan of Subdivision was premature. Mr. Lysyk requested that the  Committee consider receiving Report PDP 01-23, that Council  direct the applicant to work with the adjacent landowner to prepare  plans illustrating the overall grading and drainage of all lands within  the Brooklin 2A Sub-area Study Boundary that were mutually  acceptable to both parties, that the plans illustrate how the subject  development would be compatible and would not cause undue  hardship for the grading of the adjacent properties and adjacent  Draft Plans of Subdivision, and that upon completion of the plans, a  Staff report be presented to Council for the approval of the  development.    A question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee, Mr. Lysyk, and Mr. Ormonde regarding:  \uf0b7 the rationale for the request to delay approval of the Draft  Plan of Subdivision considering that Staff were satisfied with  the proposed grading;  \uf0b7 whether the meeting scheduled on January 27, 2023 would  result in a resolution;  \uf0b7 the status of Mr. Lysyk's Draft Plan of Subdivision  application submission and the timeline for its approval;       7  \uf0b7 the difference in the grading/elevation at the shared property  line between the two properties;  \uf0b7 clarification on the minor adjustments that Mr. Lysyk was  seeking which could occur through the detail design phase:  \uf0b7 whether Mr. Lysyk had reviewed the Draft Plan Approval  conditions; and,  \uf0b7 clarification on the future maintenance costs to the Town.   5.2.5 Lorelei Jones and Alan Zhu representing Hwy6773 Inc.

Carried    6.5  New and Unfinished Business - General Government       13  6.5.1 Advocating for Sustainable Federal Funding for PARA Marine  Search and Rescue  Councillor Mulcahy introduced a motion regarding advocating for  sustainable Federal funding for PARA Marine Search and Rescue.  A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Staff regarding whether PARA Marine Search and  Rescue has a dedicated employee to assist with fundraising.  Recommendation:  Moved by Councillor Mulcahy  Whereas PARA Marine Search and Rescue (PMSAR) is a  registered Canadian charity that has been operating with a  dedicated team of volunteers since 1967, who have contributed  thousands of hours annually to ensure the safety of individuals  participating in water activities on Lake Ontario; and,   Whereas PMSAR annually conducts over 30 search and rescue  missions in coordination with Canadian Coast Guard, from Port  Credit to Port Hope. Notable rescues include the recovery of  kayakers, children on floats, and searches for missing persons off  the shores of Lake Ontario. The unit works alongside various other  government departments including local police, fire, EMS, and  Coast Guard for both Canada and the US; and,   Whereas PMSAR's commitment to safety, teamwork, and  community has been recognized through numerous awards and  recognitions; and,   Whereas PMSAR and its volunteers play a vital role in keeping the  Lake Ontario waterfront and residents in Durham Region safe; and,   Whereas despite its vital work, PMSAR operates with minimal  federal support, relying heavily on community funding and volunteer  efforts to raise funds for major capital acquisitions; and,   Whereas the lack of direct sustainable and predictable funding from  upper-tier governments poses a significant risk to the continuity and  effectiveness of PMSAR's long-term operations; and,  Whereas PMSAR is in need of additional funding to procure a new  vessel to replace their current vessel which will be at end of life in  the mid-2030s; and,        14  Whereas ongoing annual operating funding from the federal  government will lessen the burden for PMSAR as they work  towards raising the approximately $2,000,000 required for a new  vessel.   Now therefore, be it resolved:   1. That Whitby Council calls on the Federal Government to  commit ongoing and predictable operating funding from the  federal government to PARA Marine Search and Rescue to  support the organization's long-term operational needs,  including vessel and equipment replacement, and for the  continued safety and protection of residents on Lake  Ontario;  2. That Whitby Council encourages all Durham municipalities  and the City of Toronto to bring forward similar motions  advocating for ongoing operating support for PARA Marine  Search and Rescue; and,  3. That a copy of this motion be sent to Ryan Turnbull, MP for  Whitby; Lorne Coe, MPP for Whitby; Public Safety Canada;  the Regional Municipality of Durham; all Durham Region  lower-tier municipalities; the City of Toronto; and PARA  Marine Search and Rescue.  Carried    Moved by Councillor Leahy  That a motion to introduce a matter pertaining to outdoor viewing  parties for the NHL Playoffs in Downtown Whitby be allowed due to  its timely and urgent nature.  Carried on a Two Thirds Vote    6.5.2 Outdoor Viewing Parties for the NHL Playoffs in Downtown Whitby   Councillor Leahy introduced a motion regarding outdoor viewing  parties for the NHL Playoffs in Downtown Whitby.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Staff regarding:       15  \uf0b7 the lack of visibility for an outdoor video projection due to  sunlight, and confirmation that the 1st and 2nd periods of a  hockey game may not be visible at an outdoor venue;  \uf0b7 the possibility of implementing outdoor viewing for the  conference finals should the Toronto Maple Leafs be  successful in round two of the playoffs; and,  \uf0b7 the possibility of utilizing an arena for viewing parties in time  for the Stanley Cup final.  Recommendation:  Moved by Councillor Leahy  Whereas hockey is the ultimate Canadian sport; and,  Whereas there are three Canadian hockey teams remaining in the  Stanley Cup Playoffs with the goal of making it to the Finals; and,   Whereas professional hockey provides an $11 billion economic  benefit for Canada according to a recent study by Professor Norm  O'Reilly, a Canadian researcher at Ohio University; and,   Whereas many local bars and restaurants benefit from the  excitement of a hometown or Canadian based team playing in the  Stanley Cup Playoffs; and,  Whereas it is the desire of the Whitby Mayor and Members of  Council to promote as many Whitby-based businesses in our  downtown as possible; and,  Whereas an opportunity exists for Whitby to purchase the rights to  broadcast the Toronto Maple Leafs' hockey games in a public  broadcast; and,  Whereas the Town of Whitby has exercised this right in the past  through Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment during the Toronto  Raptors historic championship basketball win; and,  Whereas it is a unique, and possibly once-in-a lifetime, opportunity  to watch the Toronto Maple Leafs win the 2025 Stanley Cup.  Now therefore, be it resolved:  1. That Whitby Council directs the Chief Administrative Officer  (CAO) and appropriate staff to negotiate the necessary       16  licence agreements, rent the appropriate equipment and  secure the best location(s) in Downton Whitby to broadcast  Toronto Maple Leafs hockey games with a suggestion to  have Celebration Square as a high priority broadcast  location; and,  2. That the CAO be instructed to find an appropriate source of  funding, and to provide information related to costs to all  Members of Council on a regular and ongoing weekly basis  as the outdoor viewing events continue.  Note: The disposition of this matter, Item 6.5.2, was determined  through the referral motion below.  Recommendation:  Moved by Councillor Leahy  That this matter be referred to Staff to provide additional  information to Council regarding considerations related to outdoor  viewing parties.  Carried    7.  Closed Session  This portion of the minutes are closed to the public. [Refer to the Closed Minutes  - Town Clerk has control and custody.]  Moved by Councillor Leahy  That Council move in-camera in accordance with Procedure By-law # 8081-24,  Closed Meeting Policy G 040, and the Municipal Act, 2001, Section 239 (2)(c) a  proposed or pending acquisition or disposition of land by the municipality or local  board.

That the Mayor and Clerk be authorized to execute a ten (10)-year  commercial restaurant lease, with an option to extend for two (2)  additional five (5)-year terms, with 301 Rowe Inc. for the Rowe  House property, located 301 Front Street West, subject to terms  substantially outlined in Confidential Report FS 01-25 and in a form  satisfactory to the Commissioners of Community Services,  Financial Services/Treasurer, and Legal and Enforcement  Services/Town Solicitor (or their respective designates);  3. That the requirement in Town Policy F-190 for the Town to provide  public notice of long-term lease and report back to Council on any  written objections received be waived; and,  4. That the Commissioner of Financial Services & Treasurer, or  designate, be authorized to enter into an agreement with 301 Rowe  Inc. to provide access to the Rowe House in advance of the  Possession Date, June 1, 2025, to allow for 301 Rowe Inc.'s  consultants to start design and other works on the property.

Ms. Gravelle stated that the apparent contravention of the contribution  limit for Nicola Cortellucci was $600 and read the written submission  provided by Nicola Cortellucci in response to the Clerk's Report.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of the  Committee and Mr. Harris regarding whether Nicola Cortellucci had  previously over-contributed to a municipal election campaign held in the  Town of Whitby.  Discussion ensued between Members of the Committee regarding:  \uf0b7 details of the letter submitted by Nicola Cortellucci, including  statements that appeared sincere;  \uf0b7 Nicola Cortellucci not having exceeded the $1,200 per candidate  contribution limit; and,  \uf0b7 the unlikeliness of Nicola Cortellucci over-contributing to candidates  in the future.

Mr. Harris confirmed that no response was received from Kenneth  Rovinelli regarding the notice sent to his attention about the apparent  over-contribution.  Mr. Harris informed Members of the Committee that in addition to mailing  a written notice to Kenneth Rovinelli, the Office of the Town Clerk office  also obtained his work related email address and sent notice to Kenneth  Rovinelli via email.   It was the consensus of the Committee to take a short recess in the event  that Kenneth Rovinelli intended to appear before the Committee but was  late. The Committee recessed at 10:02 a.m. and reconvened at 10:10  a.m.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of the  Committee and Mr. Harris regarding whether Kenneth Rovinelli had  previously over-contributed to a municipal election campaign held in the  Town of Whitby.   Members of the Committee discussed the minimal value of the over- contribution and the likelihood that the over-contribution was an  administrative error.  Moved by Kalli Chapman  That the Compliance Audit Committee has decided not to commence a  legal proceeding against contributor Kenneth Rovinelli for the apparent  contravention of Subsection 88.9(4) of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996.       4  Carried  Note: See attached Notice of Decision from the Compliance Audit  Committee  6.3  Clerk's Report to the Compliance Audit Committee \u2013 10:30 a.m.  Re: Apparent Contravention of Contribution Limit \u2013 Harpreet Taggar  Ms. Gravelle invited Onkar Taggar to appear before the Committee on  behalf of Harpreet Taggar.

Onkar Taggar further explained that Harpreet Taggar  made some contributions in 2022 and others in 2023.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of the  Committee and Mr. Onkar Taggar regarding:  \uf0b7 Harpreet Taggar's unfamiliarity with the $5,000 maximum overall  contribution limit;  \uf0b7 Harpreet Taggar's knowledge of the $1,200 maximum contribution  limit per candidate;  \uf0b7 Harpreet Taggar's contributions in previous elections; and,  \uf0b7 Harpreet Taggar's remorsefulness for the unintentional over- contribution to multiple candidates.  Ms. Gravelle asked, and Mr. Harris confirmed that Elizabeth Roy,  candidate for Mayor, filed a Notice of Extension of Campaign Period -  Form 6 which permitted contributions to be received in 2023.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of the  Committee and Mr. Harris regarding whether Harpreet Taggar had  previously over-contributed to a municipal election campaign held in the  Town of Whitby.       5  Members of the Committee discussed Harpreet Taggar's over-contribution  and the likelihood that the over-contribution was as a result of not being  informed of the limit for multiple contributions.

Onkar Taggar further  explained that Karamjit Taggar made some contributions in 2022 and  others in 2023.  A question and answer period ensued between Members of the  Committee and Mr. Onkar Tagger regarding:  \uf0b7 confirmation that all five contributions listed on the Clerk's Report  from Karamjit Taggar are from her despite two addresses being  listed for the contributions, one being a personal residence and the  other a business address;  \uf0b7 Karamjit Taggar's unfamiliarity with the $5,000 maximum overall  contribution limit;  \uf0b7 Karamjit Taggar knowledge of the $1,200 maximum contribution  limit per candidate;  \uf0b7 Karamjit Taggar's contributions in previous elections; and,       6  \uf0b7 Karmajit Taggar's remorsefulness for the unintentional over- contribution to multiple candidates.

Carried  The Meeting adjourned at 11:00 a.m.            Christopher Harris, Town Clerk                     Town of Whitby  NOTICE OF DECISION    THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY  COMPLIANCE AUDIT COMMITTEE  established pursuant to Section 88.37 of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996      IN THE MATTER OF the Town of Whitby Clerk's Report dated May 31, 2023, \"Apparent  Contravention of Contribution Limit \u2013 Nicola Cortellucci\" (the \"Clerk's Report\");  AND IN THE MATTER OF a Meeting of the Compliance Audit Committee (the  \"Committee\"), held Wednesday, May 31, 2023.  PURPOSE  Pursuant to subsection 88.34(1) of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996, the clerk is required  to review the contributions reported on the financial statements submitted by candidates  pursuant to section 88.25 of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996 to determine whether any  contributor appears to have exceeded any of the contribution limits established by section  88.9 of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996, and prepare a report identifying each  contributor who appears to have contravened any contribution limits.  The Clerk's Report identified Nicola Cortellucci (the \"Contributor\") as a contributor that  appeared to have exceed the $5,000 contribution limit to any two or more candidates  under subsection 88.9(4) of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996.   The Committee held a meeting on Wednesday, May 31, 2023 at 9:30 a.m. to consider  the Clerk's Report.  DECISION  On reviewing the Clerk's Report and the written submissions of the Contributor, and on  hearing the presentation of the Town Clerk, and on considering the provisions of the  Municipal Elections Act, 1996, it is the decision of the Committee not to commence a legal  proceeding against the Contributor pursuant to subsection 88.34(8) of the Municipal  Elections Act, 1996.  REASONS   The reasons for the decision are as follows:  1. The Clerk's Report identified that the Contributor made seven separate  contributions to candidates on Town Council, totalling $5,600.00.  This exceeds  the maximum contribution limit by $600.00.             2. The Contributor was not in attendance at the Meeting, however the Contributor  provided correspondence to the Committee to explain the apparent contravention.   The Contributor admitted to and accepted responsibility for the overcontribution,  which he stated was a result of signing numerous cheques and not keeping track  of total contributions to candidates in the Town of Whitby.  3. The Committee is of the opinion that commencing a legal proceeding against the  Contributor would not be in the public interest.  Although the Contributor exceeded  the maximum contribution limit, the Committee accepts the Contributor's  acknowledgment of his error and expression of sincere apology.  4. On that basis, the Committee has decided not to commence a legal proceeding  against the Contributor.  53224813.1     Town of Whitby  NOTICE OF DECISION    THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY  COMPLIANCE AUDIT COMMITTEE  established pursuant to Section 88.37 of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996      IN THE MATTER OF the Town of Whitby Clerk's Report dated May 31, 2023, \"Apparent  Contravention of Contribution Limit \u2013 Kenneth Rovinelli\" (the \"Clerk's Report\");  AND IN THE MATTER OF a Meeting of the Compliance Audit Committee (the  \"Committee\"), held Wednesday, May 31, 2023.  PURPOSE  Pursuant to subsection 88.34(1) of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996, the clerk is required  to review the contributions reported on the financial statements submitted by candidates  pursuant to section 88.25 of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996 to determine whether any  contributor appears to have exceeded any of the contribution limits established by section  88.9 of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996, and prepare a report identifying each  contributor who appears to have contravened any contribution limits.  The Clerk's Report identified Kenneth Rovinelli (the \"Contributor\") as a contributor that  appeared to have exceed the $5,000 contribution limit to any two or more candidates  under subsection 88.9(4) of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996.   The Committee held a meeting on Wednesday, May 31, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. to consider  the Clerk's Report.  DECISION  On reviewing the Clerk's Report and on hearing the presentation of the Town Clerk, and  on considering the provisions of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996, it is the decision of the  Committee not to commence a legal proceeding against the Contributor pursuant to  subsection 88.34(8) of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996.  REASONS   The reasons for the decision are as follows:  1. The Clerk's Report identified that the Contributor made five separate contributions  to candidates on Town Council, totalling $5,050.00.  This exceeds the maximum  contribution limit by $50.00.             2. The Committee was advised by the Clerk that the Contributor was provided notice  of the Clerk's Report and the Meeting through multiple methods.  The Contributor  did not provide any written submissions or materials to the Committee in response  to the Clerk's Report, nor was the Contributor in attendance at the Meeting.  The  Committee briefly stood down to afford the Contributor additional time to attend.  3. The Committee is satisfied that the Contributor has exceeded the maximum  contribution limit to two or more candidates.  Despite this, the Committee is of the  opinion that commencing a legal proceeding against the Contributor would not be  in the public interest.  The Committee considers the amount of the  overcontribution, being $50, to be de minimus.   4. On that basis, the Committee has decided not to commence a legal proceeding  against the Contributor.  53225217.1     Town of Whitby  NOTICE OF DECISION    THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY  COMPLIANCE AUDIT COMMITTEE  established pursuant to Section 88.37 of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996      IN THE MATTER OF the Town of Whitby Clerk's Report dated May 31, 2023, \"Apparent  Contravention of Contribution Limit \u2013 Harpreet Taggar\" (the \"Clerk's Report\");  AND IN THE MATTER OF a Meeting of the Compliance Audit Committee (the  \"Committee\"), held Wednesday, May 31, 2023.

The Committee held a meeting on Wednesday, May 31, 2023 at 10:30 a.m. to consider  the Clerk's Report.  DECISION  On reviewing the Clerk's Report and on hearing the presentation of the Town Clerk, and  on hearing the oral presentation of Onkar Taggar, agent for the Contributor, and on  considering the provisions of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996, it is the decision of the  Committee not to commence a legal proceeding against the Contributor pursuant to  subsection 88.34(8) of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996.  REASONS   The reasons for the decision are as follows:  1. The Clerk's Report identified that the Contributor made five separate contributions  to candidates on Town Council, totalling $6,000.00.

The Committee notes that this matter deals with substantially the same facts as  two other matters before the Committee regarding other individuals who also  appear to have contravened the maximum contribution limit.  3. Mr. Onkar Taggar appeared as agent on behalf of the Contributor. Mr. Taggar  advised that the Contributor is his brother's daughter in-law.  4. Mr. Taggar confirmed for the Committee that the Contributor did in fact make the  five contributions identified in the Clerk's Report.  5. Mr. Taggar advised that the Contributor was not aware of the $5,000.00  contribution limit to two or more candidates.

The Committee notes that pursuant clause 88.22(1)(r) of the Municipal Elections  Act, 1996, candidates have a duty to ensure that contributors are informed of the  maximum contribution limits applicable to both one single candidate, and to two or  more candidates on the same council.  7. On Mr. Taggar's advisement, the Committee is satisfied that the Contributor was  not aware of the maximum contribution limit to two or more candidates at the time  of the contributions, but is now aware of the limit.  Mr. Taggar also advised that it  is the Contributor's intention not to overcontribute in future elections.  8. The Clerk also advised the Committee that the Contributor does not have a past  history of apparent contraventions in the Town.   9. The Committee is satisfied that the Contributor has exceeded the maximum  contribution limit to two or more candidates.  However, the Committee is satisfied  on the record before it that the Contributor was not aware of the $5,000.00  maximum contribution limit to two or more candidates on the same council, nor  was the Contributor informed by candidates of this limit.  The Committee also notes  that the Contributor does not have a history of contraventions, but is now aware of  the maximum contribution limit.  10. On that basis, the Committee has decided not to commence a legal proceeding  against the Contributor.  53226317.1     Town of Whitby  NOTICE OF DECISION    THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY  COMPLIANCE AUDIT COMMITTEE  established pursuant to Section 88.37 of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996      IN THE MATTER OF the Town of Whitby Clerk's Report dated May 31, 2023, \"Apparent  Contravention of Contribution Limit \u2013 Karamjit Taggar\" (the \"Clerk's Report\");  AND IN THE MATTER OF a Meeting of the Compliance Audit Committee (the  \"Committee\"), held Wednesday, May 31, 2023.

In the next 10 years, the  demand for long-term care in the Region is projected to increase by 38%.  In the Region, the median number of days people waiting to move into a  long-term care home was 260 days \u2013 30% higher than the provincial  median;   And Whereas Community Care Durham has been a long-standing and  trusted non-profit health and social services provider in Whitby, offering a  vast array of services such as Assisted Living, Transportation, Day  Programs, Meal and Food Security, Mental Wellness supports, and other  services;  And Whereas Community Care Durham is seeking Provincial and  Regional support to implement a new program \u2013 OneConnect \u2013 that is  modeled after the U.S.A.'s Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly  (PACE). This program coordinates comprehensive health and wellness       8  services around vulnerable clients (e.g., those awaiting placement in long- term care) living in the community in order to help them and their  caregivers live optimally at home, in the community;  And Whereas other Ontario municipalities are looking to support the  adoption of PACE-like models, including municipalities in the Region  (Ajax, Scugog, Pickering);  And Whereas implementation of Community Care Durham's OneConnect  program in Whitby would benefit residents, while alleviating demands on  local hospitals and related healthcare institutions;  And Whereas Goal 9 of the Age-Friendly Whitby Action Plan adopted in  2017 is to ensure that Seniors have access to supports in order to help  them maintain their homes and age in place;   And Whereas Community Care Durham is publicly funded by the Ministry  of Health and Long-Term Care through Ontario Health \u2013 East Region, and  requires new funding to implement OneConnect.  Now therefore, be it resolved:  1. That Whitby Council supports Community Care Durham's vision for  implementing OneConnect in Whitby and the Region of Durham;  2. That Whitby Council encourages the Government of Ontario to  provide the necessary funding to Community Care Durham to  implement, evaluate and scale OneConnect to meet the growing  needs of the Region of Durham;  3. That Town of Whitby Staff continue to assist the Region of Durham  and Community Care Durham in future site-planning for expanded  Day Program services, and identification of Whitby neighbourhoods  where there are a high proportion of at risk adults that could benefit  from this comprehensive model; and,  4.

Deputy Mayor Mulcahy assumed the Chair and presided over  this portion of the meeting.  A brief discussion ensued between Members of Council regarding  balancing the intake of international students and ensuring that adequate  housing supply remained available.  Resolution # 60-25  Moved by Mayor Roy  Seconded by Councillor Shahid  Whereas the Town of Whitby recognizes the significant contributions of  Durham College to our local economy and community through its diverse  range of programs and skilled graduates; and,        16  Whereas the recent changes to the International Student Program (ISP)  by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) have negatively  impacted post-secondary institutions in Ontario, including Durham  College, by reducing international student study permits and limiting  eligibility for Post Graduation Work Permits (PGWP) to programs in fields  of study identified as having national labour market shortages, irrespective  of local labour market needs; and,   Whereas the Blue Ribbon Panel report commissioned by the provincial  government highlighted the need for long-term, sustainable funding for the  postsecondary sector, noting that Ontario's colleges are funded at 44% of  the national average, with tuition revenue first cut by 10% in 2019 and  then frozen for the past six years; and,   Whereas the financial sustainability challenges faced by Ontario's post- secondary institutions have been exacerbated by significant wage and  cost inflation, as well as the growing reliance on international enrolment;  and,   Whereas Durham College has compiled a short list 34 programs not  currently PGWP eligible to the IRCC list of fields of study (Attachment #1)  which provide skilled graduates who are vital to growing our local  economy, and in some cases, the College relies on international student  enrolment in these programs to create financially viable cohorts for  domestic students;  Now Therefore be it Resolved:  1. That Whitby Council calls on the federal government to add the 34  programs listed in Attachment #1 and offered at Durham College to  the IRCC list of fields of study;  2. That Whitby Council calls on the provincial government to enact the  recommendation in the Blue Ribbon Panel report to provide long  term, sustainable funding for the post-secondary sector; and,  3. That a copy of this resolution be sent to the Honourable Rachel  Bendayan, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship  Canada; the Honourable Nolan Quinn, Minster of Colleges and  Universities; Durham Region MPPs; and all Durham Region  municipalities.         17    For  Against  Conflict  Mayor Roy  X      Councillor Bozinovski  X      Councillor Cardwell  X      Councillor Leahy  X      Councillor Lee  X      Councillor Lundquist  X      Councillor Mulcahy  X      Councillor Shahid  X      Results  8  0  0    Carried Unanimously on a Recorded Vote (8 to 0)    Mayor Roy resumed the Chair.  12.2 Investigation regarding Councillor Yamada's treatment during his tenure  as Deputy Mayor  Note: This item was withdrawn from the agenda at the request of the  Member who introduced the Notice of Motion.

Resolution # 20-25  Moved by Councillor Leahy  Seconded by Councillor Bozinovski  Whereas Canada is experiencing a significant housing crisis,  characterized by an increasing demand for rental housing and a  decreasing availability of affordable housing options for individuals and  families; and,  Whereas the housing shortages continue to pose challenges in Durham  Region, including Whitby, and are exacerbated by rising rental rates,  limited affordable housing stock, and a shortage of social and supportive  housing, all of which have placed immense strain on the ability of low- and  moderate-income individuals and families to find stable, affordable  housing; and,  Whereas unscrupulous renovictions, a practice where landlords initiate  evictions under the guise of major renovations or improvements to rental  properties, have become a pervasive problem across Ontario, contributing  further to housing instability and displacement of vulnerable tenants; and,  Whereas tenants who are wrongfully evicted in the name of renovations  often face severe financial hardship, difficulty finding new rental  accommodation, and emotional distress, while landlords may unlawfully  profit from these evictions under the pretext of property upgrades; and,  Whereas the current legal and regulatory frameworks governing  renovictions and tenant protections have proven insufficient to safeguard  vulnerable tenants, leading to calls for stronger legislative action and more  robust enforcement mechanisms to protect renters from exploitative  practices; and,  Whereas municipalities have expressed concern about the negative  impact that unscrupulous renovictions have on their communities,  particularly with regard to housing availability, tenant displacement, and  social equity; and,       18  Whereas it is of urgent public interest to implement stronger safeguards to  protect tenants from renoviction abuse.  Now therefore be it Resolved:   1. That Staff be directed to investigate the feasibility, benefits, and  cost of adopting a rental unit renovation by-law that would require  landlords who issue an eviction notice (N-13) to a tenant to  demolish, repair or renovate a unit to apply to the Town within a  defined timeframe for a renovation licence prior to starting any  work; and,  2. That the intent of such a rental unit renovation by-law and  renovation licence program would be to protect affordable housing  units by ensuring that tenants understand their right to move back  into the unit once renovations are complete and by requiring  landlords, for the duration of the renovation, to secure their tenant  temporary arrangements that are comparable to the tenant's  current unit or provide the tenant compensation in lieu; and,  3. That Staff be directed to investigate the feasibility, benefits, and  cost of a by-law and permitting program regarding the demolition or  conversion to non-residential rental units of six (6) or more  residential rental units pursuant to Section 99.1 of the Municipal  Act, 2001.

Moved by Councillor Leahy  Seconded by Councillor Yamada  1.

Resolution # 22-25  Moved by Councillor Leahy  Seconded by Councillor Yamada  Whereas in recent years, Nazi iconography has surfaced with alarming  frequency in the public sphere, used by an increasing number of groups  and individuals to promote hate and instill fear within Canadian society;  and,  Whereas since the atrocities of WWII, Nazi symbols of hate have become  universally synonymous with systematic violence, terror and hate. The  growing presence of Nazi symbols of hate in our country poses a threat to  every single Canadian citizen, undermining the core values of equality,  diversity, and inclusion that define our nation; and,  Whereas eighteen countries have already taken action to ban these  symbols. It is imperative that Canada follow suit.  Now Therefore be it Resolved:  1. That Whitby Council supports B'Nai Brith's call to the Government  of Canada to pass legislation banning the public display of Nazi  symbols of hate and iconography. Specifically, demanding that the  Government of Canada immediately:  o Ban the Nazi Hakenkreuz  o Ban all Nazi symbols and iconography  2. That Whitby Council agrees that the people of Canada are counting  on the federal government to ensure a future free from hate, where  every Canadian is protected, valued, and respected.

Carried on a Two Thirds Vote  Mayor Roy introduced a motion regarding Support of Provincial and  Federal Negotiations with the U.S. Government on Trade Tariffs.  Discussion ensued between Members of Council regarding the significant  challenges tariffs would have on the Canadian and local economy, how  supply chains would be impacted, and the importance of prioritizing the  purchase of Canadian products.  Resolution # 25-25  Moved by Councillor Mulcahy  Seconded by Mayor Roy  Whereas the Windsor-Detroit border crossing is the busiest commercial  border crossing between Canada and the U.S., handling approximately  one-third of all trade between the two countries (about $1 billion per day);  and,  Whereas If Ontario were a standalone country, it would be the U.S.'s third- largest trading partner with a near-perfect balance in two-way trade  totalling CAD $493 billion in 2023, employing millions of workers on both  sides of the border.  Whereas the Ontario government estimates that the impact of the  proposed tariffs on Canadian goods by the U.S. government could  450,000 - 500,000 Ontario jobs; and,  Whereas Premier Doug Ford has outlined Ontario's forthcoming Fortress  Am-Can plan, which focuses on strengthening trade between Ontario and  the U.S. focusing on key issues include national security, integrated and  safe electricity grids, building out critical mineral supply chains and  advanced manufacturing supply chains while bringing good jobs back  home for workers on both sides of the border; and,  Whereas the federal government has established the Canada-U.S.  relations council to support the federal government as it deals with       28  possible U.S tariffs that includes representatives from the auto sector,  unions, industry and agriculture; and ,  Whereas trade between Ontario and the United States is very important to  our residents and local economies and requires all levels of government to  work together in the best interest of those residents.  Whereas according to data from the Association of Municipalities of  Ontario, across Ontario municipalities are expected to spend  approximately $290 billion on infrastructure in the next 10 years; and,  Whereas municipalities have traditionally been prevented by trade  agreements from giving preference to Buy Canadian; and,  Whereas many businesses in Whitby, including those in the  manufacturing, automotive, and agricultural sectors, will face significant  challenges because of U.S. imposed tariffs; and,  Whereas the Town of Whitby is actively engaging with local businesses,  the Regional Municipality of Durham and other lower tier municipalities  (including the membership of the Ontario Big City Mayors caucus) to  understand the potential impacts of proposed U.S. tariffs and to  collaborate on strategies to strengthen the local economy.  Therefore, be it resolved that, The Town of Whitby supports the provincial  and federal governments efforts to strike a trade deal with the United  States that will see a win for all involved when it comes to strengthening  our economy and keeping Ontario jobs;  And that we call on the Prime Minister, federal ministers and the federal  government's newly established Canada-U.S. relations council to take any  and all measures to protect the interests of Ontario in any upcoming trade  negotiations;  And that we ask the federal and provincial governments to remove any  impediments to municipalities preferring Canadian companies for capital  projects and supplies.   Be it further resolved that copies of this motion be sent to:   The Right Hon. Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada   The Hon. Doug Ford, Premier of Ontario   The Hon.

Carried.                         Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   B/05/25  Yaso Somalingam   72 Meadow Cres   An application has been received from Yaso Somalingam (on behalf of Emmanuel  Neranjala) for consent at 72 Meadow Cres.  The application is to permit the severance of a 72 Meadow Cres into 2 lots. The  proposed severed lands will measure 728 m2 and the proposed retained lands will  measure 728 m2. Each lot is proposed to have a 2-storey single-detached dwelling.   This application is related to minor variance applications A/12/25 and A/13/25 to permit  the proposed lot sizes for the retained and severed lands.   In Support of Application:    Jonathan Benczkowski (Owner Representative)            Yaso Somalingam (Applicant/Owner Representative)            Larkshana Yasotharan (Owner Representative)  In Opposition of Application:   Brian Pratt (Resident)            Karen Pratt (Resident)            Bernard Lewis (Resident)  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.   J. Benczkowski introduced himself as a Planner representing the owner and provided a  brief presentation on the proposal, the requested severance, and the requested  variances. J. Benczkowski presented examples of neighbouring properties and  explained that the proposed lot sizes and dwelling designs for the subject property are  similar to and compatible with what currently exists in the neighbourhood. J.  Benczkowski also presented a rendering demonstrating the proposed massing next to  the approximate massing of the neighbouring dwellings.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  J. Cardwell asked if any consideration was made to build bungalows instead of 2-storey  dwellings.  J. Benczkowski responded that bungalows were not considered as the proposed  dwellings fully comply with the Zoning By-law's provisions, including the applicable  height restrictions.  K. Docherty asked for clarification on the current lot dimensions and on how many  dwellings are proposed.    Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   J. Benczkowski responded that the lot currently measures 38 m in depth and 38 m in  width. J. Benczkowski clarified that 2 2-storey dwellings are proposed and that the  rendering showed 4 dwellings as it included the neighbouring dwellings. The rendering  served to provide more context on the scale and massing of the proposed dwellings  relative to the neighbouring properties.  K. Docherty asked if the dwellings are mirror images of each other.  J. Benczkowski responded yes. J. Benczkowski further stated that the applicant is  flexible should the Committee impose a condition that the 2 dwellings shall not be mirror  images of one another.  K. Docherty agreed that a condition could be imposed to make both dwellings have  unique designs. K. Docherty stated that the architectural designs should be based on  what already exists in the neighbourhood and that the proposed dwellings should match  the existing aesthetics in the area.  N. Chornobay asked for clarification on what is meant by 'mirror images' and what  changes could be proposed to the designs.  J. Benczkowski responded that the 2 proposed dwellings are currently identical  massings and have identical facades, however, that each dwelling can be give given  different facades and fenestration, as well as different materiality. J. Benczkowski  further explained that because no variances were required to allow the proposed  dwellings, they do not have to resubmit any plans and reapply for more variances if they  change the appearance of the proposed dwellings.  N. Chornobay asked Planning Staff if the Town offers architectural control.  J. Malfara responded that for developments that only require a building permit,  architectural control is not a requirement, unlike for subdivisions or site plan  applications.   There were no further questions from the Committee.   The Chair asked R. Chow, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  R. Chow advised the Committee that 4 emails were received in objection of the  proposal, and that these emails were forwarded to the Committee for their consideration  prior to the hearing.   The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.   Brian Pratt and Karen Pratt introduced themselves as residents of the neighbourhood  living across the street from the subject property. B. Pratt stated that more homes in the  neighbourhood are smaller older bungalows than larger newer homes. B. Pratt further   Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   explained that the severance done at 52 Meadow Cres a few years ago was not  appreciated by many community members as the newer homes altered the look of the  neighbourhood. B. Pratt stated that he was concerned the proposal for 72 Meadow  would not fit the look of the neighbourhood either, while also increasing traffic on a quiet  street with no curbs.   K. Pratt stated that while she understands that smaller lots are now more common than  in the past, among the nearby lots that were previously severed, none contain large 2- storey dwellings. The larger homes in the area have larger setbacks as well. K. Pratt  further stated that due to the slope of the street, the proposed 2-storey dwellings will  appear even taller than their actual height.  B. Pratt stated that the applicants of 52 Meadow Cres had also initially proposed 2- storey dwellings but that they revised their plans and ended up building bungalofts. B.  Pratt expressed that the proposal for 72 Meadow Cres feels different compared to the  development at 52 Meadow Cres as well as the other existing properties in the area. B.  Pratt acknowledged that while change will come into their neighbourhood in the future,  the applicant should be mindful and careful of how their proposal will affect those living  around the subject property.   Bernard Lewis introduced himself as a resident of the neighbourhood and stated that he  agreed with B. Pratt and K. Pratt's comments. B. Lewis stated that the homes in the  middle of Meadow Cres are bungalows while the larger homes in the area are located  along the perimeter of the neighbourhood backing onto green space and parks. B.  Lewis expressed that the proposed 2-storey dwellings will stand out among the adjacent  bungalows and destroy the image of the area. The proposal should be revised similar to  how the previous development at 52 Meadow Cres revised their application from taller  dwellings to bungalofts.  N. Chornobay stated that while he is ready to make a motion for approval, he is aware  of the concerns from the community regarding design and that a condition of approval  should be added to consider the design of the future dwellings.   The Chair asked if such a condition should be imposed on the severance application or  if it should be imposed on the related minor variance applications.  R. Chow responded that the severance application is solely to implement the severance  of the lot, not to permit the construction of any dwellings. If a condition of approval for  the severance were to be related to the design of the proposed dwellings, the applicant  would not be able to complete the severance without progressing on the development of  the dwellings. However, the 2 dwellings would not be permitted to be built without a  completed severance. Any condition related to design should therefore be placed on the  minor variance applications instead.  K. Kram responded that a design-related condition of approval should be placed on the  minor variance applications rather than the consent application. Severance conditions   Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   are only applicable prior to the applicant creating the new lots, while minor variance  conditions remain on a lot in perpetuity.   N. Chornobay stated that the Committee should then apply a design-related condition of  approval on the related minor variance applications rather than on the severance  application.  Moved by: N. Chornobay.   That the application to permit the severance of 72 Meadow Cres to create a lot  measuring 728 m2 in area and to retain a lot measuring 728 m2 be Granted subject to  the following conditions:  1. That the applicant satisfies all the requirements of the Regional Municipality of  Durham concerning the provision of regional services, financial and otherwise;   2. That the applicant satisfies the requirements of the Soil and Groundwater  Assessment Protocol by completing and submitting a Site Screening  Questionnaire signed by a Qualified Professional (QP);   3. That the applicant obtains any required minor variances to ensure compliance  with Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784;  4. That the applicant pays the required Release Fees to the Town of Whitby;   5. That the applicant provides a cash contribution to the Town of Whitby for the  planting of one street tree in the boulevard of the proposed severed lot in the  amount of $550. If the boulevard cannot accommodate a street tree, a tree will  be planted on Town land elsewhere in the Town of Whitby;   6. That the applicant shall provide cash-in-lieu of parkland in accordance with  Bylaw 7733-21 and the Planning Act;   7. That the applicant submits two copies of a registered plan on the subject  parcel;   8. That the consent be subject to the following periods:   \u2022 Last date for fulfilling Conditions and the Expiry Date of Application  B/05/25 is Monday, March 22, 2027;  9.  That prior to the signing of the certificate by the Secretary-Treasurer of the  Committee of Adjustment that the consent has been given, the Secretary- Treasurer is to be advised in writing by the Region of Durham that condition  #1 has been carried out to its satisfaction;  10. And that once all the conditions contained in the Committee's Decision are  fully satisfied by the applicant, the applicant's solicitor must prepare and   Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   forward the legal document(s) with the applicable stamping fee to the Town of  Whitby, to the attention of the Secretary-Treasurer of the Committee of  Adjustment for review and approval with stamping. The document(s) will be  returned to the solicitor for registration purposes. Failing receipt by the  Secretary Treasurer of the Deed Package by the requisite date, the  application shall be deemed expired and shall lapse.  Carried  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report, and oral  submissions had an effect on the Committee's decision.                                         Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment       A/12/25 and A/13/25  Yaso Somalingam   72 Meadow Cres   Two applications have been received from Yaso Somalingam (on behalf of Emmanuel  Neranjala) for variances from the provisions of Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.   Application A/12/25 is for permission to (1) reduce the minimum required lot area from  925 m2 to 728 m2 and (2) reduce the minimum required frontage from 21.5 to 19.1 m at  72 Meadow Cres (Part 2).  Application A/13/25 is for permission to (1) reduce the minimum required lot area from  925 m2 to 728 m2 and (2) reduce the minimum required frontage from 21.5 to 19.1 m at  72 Meadow Cres (Part 1).  The requested variances are required to permit reduced lot sizes in relation to Land  Division application B/05/25. 72 Meadow Cres is proposed to be severed into 2 lots to  accommodate a two-storey single-detached dwelling on each proposed lot.  The subject property is located at 72 Meadow Cres and is zoned Residential Type 2  (R2) within Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  In Support of Application:    Jonathan Benczkowski (Owner Representative)            Yaso Somalingam (Applicant/Owner Representative)            Larkshana Yasotharan (Owner Representative)  In Opposition of Application:   Brian Pratt (Resident)            Karen Pratt (Resident)            Bernard Lewis (Resident)  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.   J. Benczkowski introduced himself as a Planner representing the owner and provided a  brief overview of the requested variances. J. Benczkowski explained that the requested  variances are to permit the proposed lot sizes, however, that the proposed dwellings are  in compliance with the Zoning By-law.   The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.    Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   K. Docherty asked the Committee is any restriction should be placed on the height of  the proposed dwellings, or such a condition would not be possible.  N. Chornobay expressed that conditions could be imposed that would ensure that the  architectural design of the proposed dwellings would be similar to other existing  dwellings in the neighbourhood. N. Chornobay stated that limiting the height would not  be possible as the Zoning By-law permits the heights of the proposed dwellings.  J. Malfara stated that the heights of the proposed dwellings comply with the Zoning By- law as of right. A condition for architectural review could be imposed if desired by the  Committee. Such a review would take place prior to the issuance of a Building Permit.  J. Benczkowski stated that they are flexible with designing unique facades for each  dwelling rather than making the dwellings mirror images of one another.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.   Karen Pratt introduced herself as a resident and asked the Committee how they got the  past applicants of 52 Meadow Cres to redesign their proposed dwellings from a 2-storey  dwelling to a bungaloft.  The Chair responded that the applicants of 52 Meadow Cres had done that on their own  volition due to feedback from the community.   K. Pratt expressed her understanding that the community will grow and that new homes  need to be built, but that she hopes that the proposed dwellings will be similar to the  existing single-storey dwellings in the neighbourhood.  Brian Pratt introduced himself as a resident and asked if the Committee would consider  the safety of their neighbourhood. B. Pratt stated that the neighbourhood has no curbs  and no sidewalks, and that adding an extra home could increase traffic making the  street less safe for young children.  N. Chornobay responded that safety is considered, however, that Meadow Cres is not a  through street and is relatively quiet for an urban area.  K. Docherty responded that she understands the residents' concerns, however, due to  provincial policies favouring intensification, many new developments are difficult to  prevent. K. Docherty suggested that residents write letters to the builder to further voice  their concerns about the style of dwelling that will be built at 72 Meadow Cres.  B. Pratt responded that the Committee should impose a condition for architectural  control.  Bernard Lewis introduced himself as a resident and stated his agreement with K. Pratt  and B. Pratt's comments. B. Lewis stated that the centre of Meadow Cres is made up  entirely of bungalows and that any 2-storey dwellings are located along the perimeter of   Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   the neighbourhood. B. Lewis stated that similar to the development at 52 Meadow Cres,  the applicant should consider building 1-storey dwellings at 72 Meadow Cres to  maintain the current appearance of the neighbourhood.  There were no further comments.  The Chair asked R. Chow, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  R. Chow advised the Committee that 4 emails were sent in objection to the related  severance and minor variance applications at 72 Meadow Cres. The emails were  forwarded to the Committee for their consideration prior to the hearing.  Moved by: N. Chornobay.

Call of the Roll: The Clerk  3.  Declarations of Conflict of Interest  There were no declarations of conflict of interest.       2  4.  Consent Agenda  Prior to consideration of Planning and Development matters, Councillor Mulcahy  recognized Mayor Roy for her response to and actions undertaken at the scene  of a recent vehicle accident that occurred on the Don Valley Parkway en route to  a Town related event in Toronto. Councillor Mulcahy additionally requested that  Council and the community support the advocacy campaign for a new hospital in  Whitby.  5.  Planning and Development  Councillor Mulcahy assumed the Chair.  5.1  Presentations  There were no presentations.  5.2  Delegations  5.2.1 Wenda Abel, Resident (In-Person Attendance)  Re: PDE 02-24, Planning and Development (Engineering Services)  Department Report           Port Whitby Traffic Consideration  Refer to Item 5.4.1, PDE 02-24  Wenda Abel, Resident, appeared before the Committee and  advised that she was pleased that the pedestrian crosswalk for  Watson Street at the Waterfront Trail was approved, noting that its  installation was a priority due to the pedestrian and vehicle traffic  increasing as summer approaches. She enquired about the  rationale to exclude the portion of Watson Street east of Charles  Street from the Community Safety Zone and requested that  consideration be given to include the eastern portion of Watson  Street to Harbour Street. She stated that signage was in place for a  speed limit of 40 km/h on streets in Whitby Shores and asked why  a Traffic Study would need to be undertaken prior to lowering the  speed limit to 40 km/h in Port Whitby. Ms. Abel noted the area  residents' frustration due to the continued speeding and aggressive  driving as speed limits remain at 50 km/h. She stated that it was  counterintuitive not to lower the speed limit to 40 km/h throughout  Port Whitby in tandem with the Community Safety Zone on Brock  Street and Watson Street. Ms. Abel stated that the installation of  speed humps on Watson Street East and Charles Street south of       3  Watson Street was a high priority to reduce speed, aggressive  driving, and heavy trucks on busy residential streets. Ms. Abel  noted that speed humps could be approved and installed quickly.  She stated that the signalization at the intersection of Brock Street  and Watson Street was urgent due to children, school buses,  transport trucks, and speeding vehicles in the area. She requested  that a pedestrian crosswalk or a crossing guard be implemented  right away at this intersection to provide children safe passage  across the street to board school buses and travel to Watson Park.  Ms. Abel stated that the on-road planters, wayfinding signage,  construction traffic rerouting, and radar speed feedback signage  were helpful but provide little contribution to deter speeding,  aggressive driving, and truck incursion. She indicated that the Port  Whitby safety and traffic control measures have not been updated  to reflect changes in conditions for 10 years, noting the number of  years of advocacy by her neighbour which has finally resulted in a  plan for solutions. She urged Council to be proactive and to direct  Staff to prepare implementation timelines for the traffic calming  measures to make Port Whitby safer.  5.3  Correspondence  There was no correspondence.  5.4  Staff Reports  5.4.1 PDE 02-24, Planning and Development (Engineering Services)  Department Report   Re: Port Whitby Traffic Consideration   A question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Staff regarding:  \uf0b7 confirmation that the Region would have to approve a  reduction in the speed limit on Brock Street, and that the  cost for improvements along Victoria Street or Brock Street  would be financed by the Region;  \uf0b7 establishing a base line for current parking and traffic  infraction volumes to determine the effectiveness of  additional enforcement by By-law Services and the Durham  Regional Police Service;       4  \uf0b7 whether there was a traffic plan to accommodate current and  future development in the Port Whitby area;  \uf0b7 whether consideration has been given to the Port Whitby  area with respect to the proposed legislation to eliminate the  requirement for a minimum number of parking spaces per  residence for new builds near transit areas;  \uf0b7 whether the implementation of speed humps, radar signs,  and on-road planters on Charles Street and Watson Street  were included in traffic calming plans for 2023 or 2024; and,  \uf0b7 the approximate cost to implement the traffic calming  elements in the proposed motion, clarification on the cost for  the implementation of the Community Safety Zone, and  whether the total cost would be included as part of the  allocated budget for 2024.  Recommendation:  Moved by Councillor Lundquist  1. That Report PDE 02-24 be received for information;  2. That Council direct Staff to undertake the following traffic  calming elements identified in Report PDE 02-24 in the Port  Whitby area as soon as reasonably possible in 2024:  a. Implementation of a Community Safety Zone from  Charles Street to Dufferin Street;  b. The addition of crosswalk pavement markings at stop  signs to delineate pedestrian crossings;  c. An area specific speed limit of 40 km/h and installation of  signage at entry points into the community and  supplementary signage throughout Port Whitby to advise  drivers of the speed limit;  d. Request additional enforcement from By-law Services  and Durham Regional Police Service for parking and the  Highway Traffic Act infractions, respectively; and,   3. That Item P&D-0017 be removed from the New and  Unfinished Business list.       5  Carried    5.5  New and Unfinished Business - Planning and Development  There was no new and unfinished business.  6.  General Government  Councillor Lundquist assumed the Chair.  6.1  Presentations  6.1.1 Janice Atwood and Jeff Abrams, Co-Principals, Principles Integrity  (Virtual Attendance)  Re: Correspondence # 2024-235 from Janice Atwood and Jeff  Abrams, Co-Principals, Principles Integrity regarding the Integrity  Commissioners Annual Report - Town of Whitby    Refer to Item 6.3.1, Correspondence # 2024-235 from Janice  Atwood and Jeff Abrams, Co-Principals, Principles Integrity  regarding the Integrity Commissioners Annual Report - Town  of Whitby  Jeff Abrams, Co-Principal, Principles Integrity, provided a  presentation regarding the Integrity Commissioners Annual Report  for the Town of Whitby.

A question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Mr. Abrams regarding:       6  \uf0b7 whether the Province and Integrity Commissioners were  working together to address the actions of Council Members  as they relate to the ethical themes around the Province;  \uf0b7 whether complaints received by the Integrity Commissioners  from municipalities across the Province were higher than  normal and whether there was any data indicating the  percentage of complaints on an annual basis;  \uf0b7 mitigating the weaponization of the Integrity Commissioner  should the Province decide to amend the Municipal Act to  permit vacating a Member's seat on Council;  \uf0b7 discussion about whether a Member of Council would have  to bear the cost of their defence should a complaint be  administered by an Integrity Commissioner; and,  \uf0b7 whether there would be any recourse for a Member of  Council in a situation where there were repeated frivolous or  vexatious complaints.  It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 6.3.1,  Correspondence # 2024-235 from Janice Atwood and Jeff Abrams,  Co-Principals, Principles Integrity regarding the Integrity  Commissioners Annual Report - Town of Whitby, at this time.  6.1.2 Peter Veiga, Manager, Waste Management Operations, Regional  Municipality of Durham (Virtual Attendance)  Re: CMS 06-24, Community Services Department Report  Blue Box Transition to Full Extended Producer Responsibility \u2013 July  1, 2024    Refer to Item 6.4.1, CMS 06-24  Peter Veiga, Manager, Waste Management Operations, Regional  Municipality of Durham, appeared before the Committee and  provided a PowerPoint presentation regarding the blue box  transition to full extended production responsibility.
