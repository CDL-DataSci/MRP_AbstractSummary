IN THE MEETING HALL OF THE WHITBY MUNICIPAL BUILDING That Council resolve itself into Committee of the Whole with Councillor Coe in the Chair to consider Planning Report, Item PL 66-11, Whitby Official Plan Review: Intensification Strategy \u2013 Policies for Other Intensification Sites \u2013 (OPA-2009-W/02) CARRIED Councillor Coe in the Chair. R. Short, Director of Planning introduced the report and noted that correspondence had been received from Brian Smith objecting to the introduction of medium or high density housing on the East side of Garden between Burns Street East and Consumers Drive and also from Bousfields Inc. regarding Nordeagle Development Ltd. providing their comments regarding proposed revisions to OPA No. 90. Nick MacDonald, Partner, Meridian Planning Consultants, provided a review of the process undertaken to date and outlined the highlights and intent of the revised policies related to \"Other Intensification Sites\" that provide clear guidelines and criteria governing the type of intensification at these sites. Mr. MacDonald advised that intensification in these areas occurs by exception and would need to be reviewed on a case by case basis. A question and answer period ensued between Committee members and the consultant, specifically in regard to the effect ROPA 128 would have on this amendment, clarification regarding the estimated growth numbers proposed in the report in comparison to the allocation provided by the Region of Durham, the effect of heritage designations in an identified growth area, and opportunities for balancing intensification throughout the Town. Chair Coe invited submissions from the audience. Sharon Johnston, 340 Watson Street West, Suite #418, appeared before Committee and inquired what measures were in place to prevent the Province from overturning Council decisions made in this regard and expressed concerns about the intensity of growth in the Port Whitby area and the resulting traffic congestion and need for infrastructure support. R. Short, Director of Planning advised that any affected property owner had the right to appeal to the Ontario Municipal Board but if Town policies were consistent and based on solid planning merit then chances were good that they would be upheld. S. Beale, Director of Public Works advised that transit would form an integral part of the development process and the development of the Master Transportation Plan, which provides a framework and guideline for the next 20 years, would assist in alleviating traffic congestion due to intensification growth. R. Petrie, Chief  MINUTES OF THE SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY HELD ON MONDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 2011 AT THE HOUR OF 7:00 P.M. IN THE MEETING HALL OF THE WHITBY MUNICIPAL BUILDING Administrative Officer advised that with strong planning rationale and policies that are consistently applied across the entire Town the likelihood of having them overturned by the OMB is diminished and that any infrastructure improvements are funded through development charges. Andy Billick, 43 Ennisclaire Place, appeared before Committee and enquired why the area on Highway 2 south of the Gus Brown dealership, which appeared to him to be a prime candidate for intensification, had only low density development; what the plans for development were for the Dryden Boulevard and Anderson Street area, and what the plans were for a hospital within the Town. R. Short, Director of Planning, advised the speaker that the low density development was approved through the public consultation process but there are future opportunities for higher intensification if desire is there and invited the speaker to attend at the Planning Department to review the land use and zoning on file with the Town for the Dryden Boulevard/Anderson Street area. Mayor Perkins advised the speaker that the Town has been advocating for a new hospital for some time and that the Taskforce is currently trying to convince the Province that this is the right thing to do. Mayor Perkins also advised that the Taskforce is expected to make a presentation to Council in the New Year to update them on their progress to date. Joe Worona, 10 Dymond Drive, appeared before Committee and advised that he was encouraged by the wording in the policy but concerned that the OMB might be able to overturn Council's decisions. Mr. Worona asked for clarification on the definition of underutilized and infill and expressed concern about the practice of demolishing and replacing homes in older established neighbourhoods with million dollar homes that do not mesh with the existing landscape of the area and advised that he supported the idea of mixed use intensity dwelling units to maximize the concentration of people while providing services in the area at the same time. N. MacDonald advised the speaker that underutilized does not apply to larger single family plots but deals with larger sites that can accommodate apartment buildings and townhouse type dwellings and that they are looking at policies to protect those well established residential areas. Bryce Jordan, Sernas Associations, on behalf of the West Whitby Landowners Group, appeared before Committee and suggested that the wording in 4.13.7.8.2 Criteria for Development and Redevelopment be softened to encourage a range of dwelling types as opposed to a one size fits all approach which may not be appropriate in all cases due to the size of a site or proximity.  MINUTES OF THE SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY HELD ON MONDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 2011 AT THE HOUR OF 7:00 P.M. IN THE MEETING HALL OF THE WHITBY MUNICIPAL BUILDING Robert Nixon, 9190 Ashburn Road, appeared before Committee and asked for clarification on whether the growth numbers allocated can be achieved within the existing urban boundary and expressed concern about the loss of prime agricultural land, particularly north of Columbus Road and if the Whitby Official Plan conforms with the Region's Official Plan. N. MacDonald advised the speaker that the intensification numbers can be accommodated within the built boundaries, but that intensification within the built boundary, is different from total population growth allocated to the Town of Whitby. R. Petrie, Chief Administrative Officer, clarified that the Whitby Official Plan conforms to the Regional Official Plan and that the Regional Official Plan Amendment 128 had not been approved yet by the Province. Mr. Nixon enquired when the discussion papers would be made available to the public. N. MacDonald advised that the discussion papers have been prepared and are currently going through an internal process and R. Short, Director of Planning advised that they plan to bring them before Council on November 28th not for public discussion but in order for Council to receive and to provide the public with copies. R. Short advised that due to the volume of the documents this will give everyone a chance to review them before a public meeting to be scheduled in the New Year. Joe Ieraci, 208 Wellington Street and owner of a downtown business, appeared before Committee and advised that he wants to see intensification and revitalization in the downtown area and would like to see the Whitby Carnival relocated back to the downtown core. N. MacDonald advised the speaker that the policies being discussed were supportive of current policies already in existence and that the Downtown Secondary Plan already in place allows for a range of development in the downtown area. P. Lebel, Director of Community and Marketing Services advised the speaker that staff are currently preparing a report on special events including the Carnival for 2012 which is expected to be before Committee in the first week of December. Earl Hawes, 59 Queens Road, appeared before Committee and asked for clarification on specific areas adjacent to the Highway 401/407 link. N. MacDonald advised the speaker to review the West Whitby Secondary Plan with Planning staff for a clearer understanding of the area. Mr. Hawes enquired about future intensification for the Almond Village subdivision. R. Short, Director of Planning, advised that there have been no requests made at this time and if such a request were made it would require study before proceeding. Rob Welsh, 81 Prentice Drive, appeared before Committee and asked for clarification on the definition of medium density specifically as it applies to the Garden Street and Burns Street area. R. Short, Director of Planning provided a listing of the types of homes that qualify as medium density residential. Mayor Perkins further clarified that currently the area is  MINUTES OF THE SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY HELD ON MONDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 2011 AT THE HOUR OF 7:00 P.M. IN THE MEETING HALL OF THE WHITBY MUNICIPAL BUILDING designated to accommodate a maximum height of four storeys. There were no further submissions from the public. MOVED by Mayor Perkins That Committee recess for a 5 minute break. CARRIED The meeting resumed at 9:28 pm General discussion on the matter continued regarding the need to ensure that policies clearly outline the criteria for Other Intensification Sites. MOVED by Councillor Mitchell 1. That Council approve the revisions to Amendment No. 90 to the Whitby Official Plan regarding Other Intensification Sites, as shown in Attachment #3 to PL 66-11; 2.

Re: Development Charges By-law  Craig Binning, Partner, and Jackie Hall, Consultant, Hemson Consulting  Ltd., appeared before Council and provided a PowerPoint presentation.  Highlights of the presentation included:  \uf0b7 an overview of the project to date;  \uf0b7 a summary of the current and calculated residential, commercial,  and non-commercial rates;  \uf0b7 benchmarking of residential, commercial, and industrial rates;  \uf0b7 factors responsible for changes to the development charges rate;   Special Council Minutes   January 23, 2017 - 6:00 PM    \uf0b7 proposed policies to be carried forward and introduced in the new  Development Charges By-law; and,  \uf0b7 next steps in the project.    3.  Public Meeting    3.1  Mayor Mitchell advised those in attendance that the purpose of this  Public Meeting is to receive feedback from members of the public and  that Council would not be making any decisions. He further advised that  the Public Meeting was being held with regard to the Development  Charges Study and By-law in accordance with the Development  Charges Act.  The Chair opened the floor for comments from the public.  Anita Devries, 1050 Simcoe Street North, Oshawa, appeared before  Council and stated that she was the Executive Officer of the Durham  Region Home Builders Association. Ms. Devries commented that there  is a real demand for houses in Whitby and the supply is not keeping  pace with the demand. She further commented that the association has  been in dialogue with Town staff and that further dialogue may result in  changes to current calculations. Ms. Devries advised that a request  would be made for a Fair Transition Policy in order to protect and lessen  the burden for first time home buyers. Ms. Devries explained that most  people feel threatened by fees associated with buying a first house and  the builders often get blamed because they collect the fees. She further  requested that another policy be introduced regarding secondary suites.  The Provincial Policy is changing with Bill 7 and as a result  municipalities will no longer be able to charge a development fee for  secondary suites.  A question and answer period ensued regarding:  \uf0b7 average housing prices and affordability;  \uf0b7 altering the development charge format to a percentage base  charge;  \uf0b7 the purpose of a Fair Transition Policy being subjective and to  assist first time home buyers;  \uf0b7 development charges not being applicable if a secondary suite is  added following the completion of a build;  \uf0b7 the comparison between when a house is sold and when the  building permit is issued with regard to a Fair Transition Policy;  and,  \uf0b7 the possibility of making up for a loss of development charges  due to a Fair Transition Policy by increasing development  charges for future new home buyers.

ITEM FOR CONSIDERATION BY COUNCIL IN COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE    2.1  Planning Report, PL 45-13  Re:  Official Plan Review - Proposed Draft Amendment to the Whitby  Official Plan, Healthy and Complete Communities/Cultural   Special Council Minutes   April 29, 2013 -6:00 PM    Heritage/Sustainability (OPA-2007-W/04)  Nick McDonald, Principal, Meridian Planning, appeared before Council  and provided an overview of the documents relating to the Official Plan  (OP) Review. The Proposed Draft Amendment contains policies which  are primarily high-level, overarching principles and objectives and  propose changes to the policy framework for sustainable community  planning, economic prosperity, growth management and cultural  heritage protection. The themes of upcoming meetings will take into  account healthy and complete communities, heritage and sustainability;  urban land use designations and housing; environment, greenbelt  and agriculture; and transportation and urban design.  A question and answer period ensued which focused on guiding  principles, wording regarding healthy and complete communities and  sustainable development, and the series of very specific sustainable  initiatives within a section of the draft plan. It was recommended that the  goals should be amended to clearly reflect the evolving urban area,  cultural heritage and sustainability.  The growth management rating of objectives was discussed together  with the alignment with the growth plan of the Region, the five year  review to demonstrate achievement of the intensification targets and  employment goals. The overall intensification target rests with the  Region of Durham in conjunction with ROPA 128.  R. Petrie, Chief Administrative Officer, advised that all input and  comments will be taken into consideration for future recommendations  to the OP Review. It was directed that staff incorporate a glossary of  terms into the Official Plan Review for ease of reference.  The following individuals addressed Council regarding the Official Plan  Review:  Niomie Massey, Project Manager, Madison Properties, addressed  Council regarding the lands at 5605 Baldwin Street South which are  designated as Prestige Industrial.   Ms. Massey advised that as a result  of the final configuration of the Highway 407 lands for Ministry of  Transportation use, a small and oddly configured piece of land remains,  with limited access and visibility to the property.  She expressed concern  with conformity to the Region of Durham Official Plan; potential Regional  Centre areas; and Provincial Policy Statements (PPS) dealing with  employments lands and the future conversion of these lands, as it is her  understanding there must be consistency with these plans as well as the  Brooklin Secondary Plan. Written correspondence from Ms. Massey  dated April 29, 2013 with respect to this matter was provided to all  Members of Council.  Page 2 of 5  Special Council Minutes   April 29, 2013 -6:00 PM    Questions were posed regarding the monitoring and implementation  process of the plan. The consultant advised that sustainability  strategies, standards and guidelines, performance checklists; and  impact assessments for long term monitoring will be included in the  process.  Further discussion ensued with respect to future growth in the area;  protecting industrial lands from conversion and defining what is  considered appropriate in terms of other land conversion.  There was  discussion surrounding the word \"compact\" in relation to neighbourhood  planning, in that the OP works to create density, not necessarily  compact neighbourhoods. There was discussion surrounding the  terminology of \"appropriate\" growth management, as growth should be  balanced and phased. It was suggested that design guidelines and  standards for neighbourhoods should be considered as part of the  Official Plan Review.     Resolution No. 194-13    Moved By Mayor Perkins    1. That Planning Report Item No. PL 45-13 be received for information;  2. That the Planning Department report back to the Council in  Committee of the Whole regarding a recommended Official Plan  Amendment following the consideration of input from the public,  commenting agencies and departments.    SEE FOLLOWING MOTION    Resolution No. 195-13    Moved By Mayor Perkins     That the following be added as Items 2 and 3 and that the main motion  be renumbered accordingly:  1. That in relation to Item 2.3.3.1 f) of the Proposed Draft Amendment  to the Whitby Official Plan, alternate wording be sought to the word  \"appropriately\" and replaced as necessary;  2.

CARRIED ON A TWO THIRDS MAJORITY VOTE i) Tim Pritchard, Whitby resident Re:  Planning Report, Item 61-11 Downtown Whitby Heritage Conservation District Designation Process and Design Guidelines - Approved Terms of Reference Mr. Tim Pritchard, 315 King Street, Whitby appeared before Council and  noted that he has lived in Whitby for 38 years.  Mr. Pritchard stated how  he felt it was very important to preserve and maintain the heritage in  Whitby, especially the area around the downtown four corners.  He noted  that the four corners of downtown need to be protected and the original  heritage of the buildings preserved.  Mr. Pritchard further expressed concerns regarding the development of new buildings throughout the Town and felt that new buildings in the area of the four corners would  undermine the heritage feel and charm of the neighbourhood.  He advised that great strides have already been taken but the work is only half done.   Many buildings have not been officially designated and he fears for empty  buildings such as R.A. Sennett Public School will be taken over by developers.  Mr. Pritchard would like to see a vote in favour of the  Heritage Conservation District Designation process which will finish the  job started in preserving the heritage in Whitby.  He noted that with this  preservation Whitby will be a unique community that is not found in other  municipalities.  Mr. Pritchard further added that the heritage and charm of  downtown will benefit businesses and residences alike and will attract new  businesses that will want to be part of this historical environment.  MINUTES OF THE REGULAR MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CORPORATION  OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY HELD ON TUESDAY, OCTOBER 11, 2011 AT THE  HOUR OF 7:00 P.M.

Ms.  Felgemacher plans to spend her retirement years in Whitby and  expressed the importance of preserving the heritage and old homes in  Whitby.  She stated that she has heard a number of positive comments  from others regarding the appearance of old Whitby.  Ms. Felgemacher is  pleased that Council is considering a consultant to help in the heritage  designation process and hopes that the heritage in Whitby can be  preserved for many years to come. iii) Wyatt McGillis, Whitby resident Re: Planning Report, Item 61-11 Downtown Whitby Heritage Conservation District Designation Process and Design Guidelines - Approved Terms of Reference Wyatt McGillis, 209 John Street, Whitby stated that he is originally from  Pickering and moved to Whitby with his wife and has loved it since he  moved here.  He noted that Whitby is a great place to live and would like to see heritage signs placed on the streets to draw attention to the  historical streets in Town.  Mr. McGillis hopes that Council will vote in  favor to hire a consultant for the Whitby Heritage conservation process. iv) Doug Anderson, Whitby resident Re: Planning Report, Item 61-11 Downtown Whitby Heritage Conservation District Designation Process and Design Guidelines - Approved Terms of Reference Doug Anderson appeared before Council and stated that he has lived in  downtown Whitby since 1974.  Mr. Anderson advised he has been  involved with the Whitby Historical Society for many years and he spoke of  past historical designations in the Town dating back 29 years.  Mr.  Anderson expressed concern that the Town was still talking about the  same topic all these years later and he wants to Council to move forward with making decisions regarding heritage preservation.  With all the  previous discussions on this topic Mr. Anderson questioned whether a consultant was really necessary to discuss the matter further.  He further   MINUTES OF THE REGULAR MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CORPORATION  OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY HELD ON TUESDAY, OCTOBER 11, 2011 AT THE  HOUR OF 7:00 P.M.

PRESENTATIONS    2.1  R. Petrie, Chief Administrative Officer advised Members of Council that  the purpose of the presentation was to provide an overview of the 2013  budget process. He indicated that the intent of the meeting was solely  an education and training session, with no decisions being made at this   Special Council Minutes   January 10, 2013 -1:00 PM    meeting. Council was provided with a copy of the Powerpoint  Presentation.    K. Nix, Commissioner of Corporate Services/Treasurer, with the aid of a  PowerPoint presentation, provided a detailed overview of the 2013 draft  budget. He noted that Whitby is a community of choice and addressed  community needs in various ways. Key highlights of the presentation  included:    \uf0b7 \"Living within our means\" \u2013 none of the current debt is paid with the  current tax rate; no additional debt within the 2013 draft budget;  \uf0b7 $6.1M of debt is related to the Downtown Whitby Library, $3.1M  related to the new soccer dome and marina improvements, both of  which are being re-paid entirely through user fees;  \uf0b7 Financial position can only be maintained if the Town continues to  finance ongoing expenses with ongoing revenues and uses  uncommitted reserves for special one time projects;  \uf0b7 Challenges for 2013 were outlined in detail; noting that underlying  everything was the uncertainty of the current economy;  \uf0b7 Budget strategy for 2013 is to maintain core services, take care of  assets and provide for growth;  \uf0b7 Current budget of $103M focuses on Town services and programs;  \uf0b7 Capital budget of $24M for infrastructure and major projects, based  on a 10 year plan;  \uf0b7 Council has made a conscious decision to support maintenance and  growth capital programs;  \uf0b7 Grants are primarily for the Library and the Station Gallery;  \uf0b7 Budget forecasts inflation as 2% for 2013; major impact on the  budget is a heavy reliance on labour and energy costs;  \uf0b7 Annualization of prior year decisions is at an additional cost of  $465,000, however, other budget adjustments resulted in a net  savings of $250,000;      Councillor Coe assumed the Chair at 1:30 p.m.  Mayor Perkins resumed  the Chair at 1:46 p.m.        \uf0b7 Building Permit Revenue Reserve Fund shortfall resulted in a  potential budget pressure of $660K. The Town cannot run a deficit in  this fund. It is a relatively short term pressure that needs to be  managed;  \uf0b7 In order to address the anticipated continued decrease in building  permit revenue in 2013 and offset in reserves normally used to fund  Page 2 of 4  Special Council Minutes   January 10, 2013 -1:00 PM    these pressures, staff is recommending the budget include the use of  the Long Term Finance Reserve Fund to fund this shortfall;  \uf0b7 five additional staff positions are recommended for the 2013 budget.           Questions arose with respect to the recommended staffing positions and  other requests such as Harbour Day and Ribfest events. Administration  was requested to provide additional information related to the requested  2013 positions. Discussion ensued with respect to exit interviews when  an individual leaves the corporation. Administration was further  requested to investigate whether Council could be provided with a  summary/synopsis excluding personal details. Administration was  further requested to explore employee engagement initiatives.    Questions arose with respect to benefits for Members of Council who  retire after fifteen years. It was understood that the Region of Durham  has this option and that the Town also offered this benefit. Staff  indicated that they would review the matter and provide an update to  Council.    Discussion ensued with respect to the budget reduction options that  would re-direct some of the 2012 assessment growth to offset operating  budget pressures, noting an additional $26M of debt must be issued  over the next ten years. The Chief Administrative Officer noted that the  intent of this would spread the cost of capital growth projects over a  longer term and is therefore paid for by both current and future  taxpayers who benefit from these projects; however, it increases the  total cost due to interest on the debt. Based on the discussion, it was  determined that there was a need for more details/discussion/clarity in  order to truly understand the long term impact.  A chart was requested  to outline the concept of the proposed debt impact.    Discussion ensued with respect to the reserve levels. The Chief  Administrative Officer indicated that a synopsis of past surplus levels  would be provided.    In summary, the Chief Administrative Officer noted challenges next year  would include a decrease in hydro revenues and decrease in building  permit revenue. The use of gapping would continue, and a strategic  planning session will be planned to discuss financial impacts.

CARRIED 3.1 Re: Planning Department Report, PL 09-10 Intensification Strategy \u2013 Whitby Official Plan Review \u2013 Public Meeting (OPA-2009-W/02)  MINUTES OF THE SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY HELD ON THURSDAY, MARCH 18, 2010 AT THE HOUR OF 7:00 P.M. IN THE MEETING HALL OF THE WHITBY MUNICIPAL BUILDING AS CALLED BY THE HEAD OF COUNCIL R. Short, Director of Planning, introduced the report. Chair Coe declared the meeting to be a public meeting and invited submissions from the audience. Dr. Dan Betterinski, 120 Cashay Drive, Brooklin, appeared before Committee and advised he is concerned that the areas of intensification identified in the report have already been developed and yet there are a number of areas not developed in Town and it appears they have not been considered. He also expressed concerns about the potential loss of soccer pitches, recreational areas and heritage elements in order to put up high rises to meet the intensification objectives. Stan Aveltowics, 107 Wellington Street, appeared before Committee and stated that he understood that intensification was required, noting that a balance of being able to live, work and shop was important. He noted that Whitby had a lot of commuters to Toronto, who also spend their money in Toronto which is a missed opportunity. In summary he stated that when reviewing intensification, could there be a concentration on areas to make it a true place to live, work and shop right in the community. He further advised that all parks should be left alone. Doug Anderson, Whitby resident, appeared before Committee and provided a detailed powerpoint presentation. He stated that he resided in Olde Whitby and intensification was a threat to this area. He provided an overview of past planning within the Town and felt that there was a disconnect between residential and commercial development. He advised that development should have height, rather than single storeys with wide open parking lots. In summary, he stated that the Town needed to change the perception of developable lands. Mike Baber, 408 Brock Street North, appeared before Committee and indicated that he was glad to see the provincial reports, such as the Places to Grow as it helped to move forward development within parameters. Mr. Baber concurs with previous speakers about the need for mixed and residential uses in order to meet intensification. He expressed appreciation for a very comprehensive report from Planning staff and emphasized that the Town has to be proactive in developing policy. He further advised that a peer review process should be utilized when developing a large project. He is encouraged by the idea of developing a pedestrian-friendly environment and embracing the concept of urban design. He expressed concern with the Eco-place development as the presentation at the previous meeting was very poor and they should obtain the services of an architect, rather than copying from another project. He noted that the soccer fields' needs to be redesigned as they have great potential and should be used for multi-use  MINUTES OF THE SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY HELD ON THURSDAY, MARCH 18, 2010 AT THE HOUR OF 7:00 P.M. IN THE MEETING HALL OF THE WHITBY MUNICIPAL BUILDING AS CALLED BY THE HEAD OF COUNCIL Francesco Nino, 10 Regatta Drive, advised many concerns had already been expressed tonight by previous speakers. He stated that the mandate to intensify should not be considered a problem, but rather an opportunity, especially in the Port Whitby area. He noted that the combination of live/work spaces that allow employment in the same area is key for residents. The Town needs to attract the high paying employment that provides for these opportunities. He further advised that a well planned development can become the focal point of the Town of Whitby right on the waterfront and this in turn will create employment opportunities. Andy Belick, 7 Billings Street, appeared before Committee and noted that his neighbourhood had a very active social network who have discussed this matter and understand that intensification is coming and generally support it. He advised that in supporting intensification it should be done equitability throughout the town, noting that it can take on many forms. He further advised that there is no need for high rises unless non-developed. He indicated that thoughtfulness in development, transitions in development and thinking of the big picture are essential. In summary he advised that there should be smooth transition of the development areas. Nancy Shanks, Whitby resident questioned if Camp X and Intrepid Park would be protected? She advised that she would prefer to see all plans on one map overlaid so that they can determine what it is going to look like and questioned if developers can be forced to go beyond minimum code? She questioned the amount of public access to the lakefront and if development with a mixed use was being considered. Joseph Ieraci, 228 Wellington Street, stated that he would like to see intensification in the downtown area only, specifically near four corners of downtown. He further noted that there were lots of places along main corridors that would benefit from intensification. Thomas Dawson, 22 Eva Court, appeared before Committee, and requested clarification on the status of a property south of Burns, east of Garden. Staff provided clarification on this specific item, noting that applicant had the right to participate in this process just as the other members of the public does. There being no further submissions from the public, Chair Coe closed the public meeting. RESOLUTION NO. 91-10 MOVED by Mayor Perkins 1.

That Community and Marketing Services Department Report CMS 18-10 be  received as information;    2. That Council endorse the following resolution:    \uf0b7 Whereas the Provincial Government has previously instituted an  electricity rebate program, the Northern Pulp and Paper Electricity  Transition Program, that effectively reduces the cost of electricity to  pulp and paper mills located in northern Ontario by approximately 15  percent (extended to September 2010);     MINUTES OF THE REGULAR MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CORPORATION OF  THE TOWN OF WHITBY HELD ON MONDAY, APRIL 19, 2010 AT THE HOUR OF 7:00 P.M.  IN THE MEETING HALL OF THE WHITBY MUNICIPAL BUILDING    \uf0b7 Whereas the Provincial Government has most recently announced as  part of the \"Open Ontario\" 2010 Budget the creation of a three-year  industrial electricity program averaging $150 million per year which  would reduce electricity prices by almost 25 percent based on 2009       \uf0b7 levels for all large northern Ontario industrial facilities, including the  pulp and paper industry;    \uf0b7 Whereas those companies in the pulp and paper industry, such as  Atlantic Packaging Products Ltd., that operate plants in southern  Ontario are competitively disadvantaged since they are not eligible for  the current electricity rebate program and the newly announced  industrial electricity program that will be available to pulp and paper  manufacturers in northern Ontario;      \uf0b7 Whereas the proposed lower electricity prices place an unfair  competitive advantage to northern pulp and paper manufacturers  which threatens the viability of pulp and paper plants operating in  southern Ontario and, which could contribute to the closure of these  plants resulting in significant job losses and economic adversity;     \uf0b7 Whereas the closure of pulp and paper mills in southern Ontario would  adversely effect the Province's Blue Box program by limiting its ability  to manage recycled paper domestically, thereby increasing the cost of  the program to administer;    \uf0b7 Therefore be it resolved that the Town of Whitby calls upon the  Provincial Government to level the playing field and to extend the  proposed industrial electricity rebate program announced in the \"Open  Ontario\" 2010 Budget to all pulp and paper manufacturers operating  plants throughout Ontario in order to enhance the competitiveness of  all manufacturers and provide sustainable employment; and further,  that the current electricity rebate program, the Northern Pulp and  Paper Electricity Transition Program, be immediately expanded to  include all pulp and paper manufacturers located in Ontario; and,     3.   That the Clerk forward a copy of this report, once approved by Council, to  the   Honourable Dalton McGuinty, Premier of Ontario; Honourable Brad  Duguid, Minister of Energy and Infrastructure; Honourable Sandra  Pupatello, Minister of Economic Development and Trade; Honourable  Dwight Duncan, Minister of Finance and Chair of the Management Board  of Cabinet; Honourable Linda Jeffrey, Minister of Natural Resources;              MINUTES OF THE REGULAR MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CORPORATION OF  THE TOWN OF WHITBY HELD ON MONDAY, APRIL 19, 2010 AT THE HOUR OF 7:00 P.M.

DELEGATIONS 3.1 Stacey Leadbetter Re: Response to Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation \u2013 Gaming Facility within the Town of Whitby Ms. Leadbetter appeared before Council and thanked Councillors for their efforts in exploring and discussing the matter regarding a gaming facility. Ms. Leadbetter stated that she is opposed to a casino in the Town of Whitby. She was pleased to hear of Ajax's offer and encouraged Council to accept the offer as presented. She further stated that accepting the offer would provide the financial benefit without having to contend with the hardship in the community that may come from a gambling facility. Ms. Leadbetter also commented that even though the Town may not choose to be a host to a gaming facility that there were other ways to look at cost  MINUTES OF THE SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY HELD ON MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 2012 AT THE HOUR OF 5:00 P.M. IN THE MEETING HALL OF THE WHITBY MUNICIPAL BUILDING savings and generating revenue that could be explored such as through solar energy. Ms. Leadbetter implored to Council as a resident of the community to accept the offer made by the Town of Ajax and to explore other ways to generate revenue in the Town aside from revenues that would come from a casino. 3.2 Linda Gasser Re: Response to Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation \u2013 Gaming Facility within the Town of Whitby Ms. Gasser appeared before Council and stated that she is in opposition to a casino in the Town of Whitby because of social impacts it will have in the community. Ms. Gasser stated that in her opinion, the offer from the Town of Ajax was generous and that she felt that Whitby should accept it. She further commented that if the casino remained in Ajax, next to Picov Downs Racetrack, that this would help keep the race-track facility in business preserving the many jobs that it creates. If the Town of Whitby accepts the offer from Ajax, Ms. Gasser suggested that the Town should be willing to work with Ajax and the Region to decide what the revenues will be used for and that public consultation should be considered in deciding how the revenues are used. A brief question and answer period ensued with respect to the horse- racing industry and the removal of funds by the Province. It was discussed that it would be a tragedy if the racing industry could not continue however, this matter was one that was being addressed by the Province. 3.3 Victoria Kehoe and Stacey Leadbetter, on behalf of Distress Centre Durham Re: Response to Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation \u2013 Gaming Facility within the Town of Whitby Ms. Kehoe and Ms. Leadbetter appeared before Council to speak about the social impacts a gaming facility would have on the Distress Centre. Ms. Kehoe specifically addressed the suicide rates that are associated with gambling and informed Council of the staffing impacts that would be a result of increased gambling in the community. The Distress Centre offers 24 hour call support to individuals and their families that are affected by suicide and they receive approximately 9000 calls a year on the hot-lines. Ms. Kehoe and Ms. Leadbetter made a request to Whitby Council to commit funding to the Distress Centre to help offset the costs associated with the extra strain that a casino would bring and the increased demands in staffing needed to handle the volume of calls that would be received. They requested funding in the amount of $50, 000.00 \u2013 $75, 000.00 to pay for staffing and a phone line that would be devoted to gambling issues.  MINUTES OF THE SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY HELD ON MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 2012 AT THE HOUR OF 5:00 P.M. IN THE MEETING HALL OF THE WHITBY MUNICIPAL BUILDING 3.4 Chris Butryn Re: Response to Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation \u2013 Gaming Facility within the Town of Whitby Chris Butryn, resident and business owner in the Town of Whitby appeared before Council and stated that he is involved with the Whitby Chamber of Commerce and has also been involved in land development and is currently in real estate. Mr. Butryn stated that while a casino is a departure from the norm and that the revenues that may come from it are not worth having, he has given a great deal of thought to what a casino would mean for Whitby if it was located along the 400 series of highway. He stated that having a casino in the Highway 401 corridor could put the Town in a more visible position to visitors who could experience what the Town has to offer. He further stated that he believes a casino would lead to organic growth and demand for Whitby and that it would be the kick- start to something bigger for the Town. Mr. Butryn further suggested to Council that should they become a host community, that Council should ensure that they are involved in the design of the building so that it will be appealing and will draw people in. 3.5 Dan Miles, Vice President, Whitby Chamber of Commerce Re: Response to Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation \u2013 Gaming Facility within the Town of Whitby Mr. Miles appeared before Council on behalf of the President, CEO and Board of the Whitby Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Miles stated that the Chamber supports the idea of Whitby becoming a host municipality and that the Board is in support of foregoing the Ajax offer and continuing on to explore being a host to a casino in Whitby. He further stated that the millions of additional dollars generated from a gaming facility could be used to enhance the community, which would attract tourism, bring more amenities and investors to the Town. History has shown that gaming revenues have been used to expand many important services in the province and to support local charities and although there are risks associated with having a casino in the Town there are also many benefits. In taking a responsible position in the community, Mr. Miles suggested to Council that up to 20% of all gaming revenues received by the Town should be set aside for police and social services cost to help with any negative impact a gaming facility might have. He further recommended that the casino be located along a 400 series of highway and away from residential areas. A question and answer period ensued regarding the benefits and effects of a casino in the Town.

MINUTES OF THE SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY HELD ON MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 2012 AT THE HOUR OF 5:00 P.M. IN THE MEETING HALL OF THE WHITBY MUNICIPAL BUILDING R. Petrie, Chief Administrative Officer, provided a verbal update of the meeting that took place between the Town of Ajax and the Town of Whitby. During the meeting Ajax was informed that although there was no specific percentage mentioned in Resolution 209-12, Whitby Town Council had informally discussed possible percentages of 15, 20 or 25% during the meeting. After the meeting a letter was received from the Town of Ajax asking that Whitby defer their decision on the matter and the scheduled August 14, 2012 meeting in order to allow Ajax Council to meet and discuss the matter. The Town of Ajax held a meeting on August 24, 2012 and the Ajax council provided an offer of revenue sharing of 15%. There were some items in the original offer that required clarification and Mr. Petrie drew attention to the letter of offer and the email from Brian Skinner, Chief Administrative Officer for the Town of Ajax where clarification was given to some of the points in the offer. Specifically the clarifications were that revenues would come from all gaming sources and not just slot revenue, that no matter where the casino was located in Ajax that Whitby would still receive shares of the revenue and that Whitby would not be able to notify the OLG until the day after the Special Council Meeting on September 10, 2012.
