Petrie, Chief Administrative Officer provided handouts to Members of Council, and provided an overview in this regard. He noted that he had come to the conclusion that despite the Community Strategic Plan (CSP) being out of date, it in fact mirrors closely to the Regional Strategic Plan and the four pillars of sustainability. He noted that there was concern from a staff level that due to the number of projects on the go, that another community consultation process would be too much for the public and so determined at the last meeting to complete an update only of the plan. He indicated that key elements of the CSP would be establishing the benchmarks to determine where you are at, where Council wants to get to and where it matches with the CSP.  MINUTES OF THE SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY HELD ON MONDAY, JANUARY 11, 2012 AT 6:00 PM AT THE REGAL ROOM, CENTENNIAL BUILDING He advised that the first thing to do is to try and identify what we do and what part of the strategic plan these things fulfill, define the objectives to what we are doing in terms of the objective of the CSP ie: business plan is in line with the CSP. In summary, he noted that the end result would be that he would come back with a revised corporate strategic plan, and attached to this plan would be a business plan that specifically says that over the next four years this is what we are going to do, noting that timelines would be established as well.

Mr. O'Regan provided an overview of the justifications of why the  foundations were merging, stating that the joined foundations would  provide for a stronger, unified foundation that would be able to  provide more funding and focus to upcoming projects that will be  undertaken by Lakeridge Health Corporation.  He further stated that the  timing of the joining of the foundations was right and the venture was  driven by both the Whitby and Oshawa Foundations.  He advised that  the new Foundation would be in a better position to attract donors and  make an impact in this highly competitive market.  A detailed question and answer period ensued.  Council asked about the \"Buy a Bed Campaign\" and  requested assurance from Mr. Empey that the money raised for this  purpose would be used to purchase the beds that were decided on  during the campaign.  Mr. Empey and Mr. O'Regan both assured  Council that any monies raised for specific purposes would be used  accordingly and the joining of the two foundations did not have an  impact in this regard.  Discussion ensued regarding the Whitby branch office and Mr. O'Regan  stated that the Whitby office would remain open and staffed.  Mr. O'Regan stated that the Foundations will merge as of April 1, 2013  with the Annual General Meeting scheduled for June 2013.  He further  stated that the foundation's next steps include a communications plan to  the community and donors to provide information and assurance  regarding the service delivery of programs and initiatives that the new  Foundation will be undertaking as they move forward.
