The Proposed Draft Amendment contains policies which  are primarily high-level, overarching principles and objectives and  propose changes to the policy framework for sustainable community  planning, economic prosperity, growth management and cultural  heritage protection. The themes of upcoming meetings will take into  account healthy and complete communities, heritage and sustainability;  urban land use designations and housing; environment, greenbelt  and agriculture; and transportation and urban design.  A question and answer period ensued which focused on guiding  principles, wording regarding healthy and complete communities and  sustainable development, and the series of very specific sustainable  initiatives within a section of the draft plan. It was recommended that the  goals should be amended to clearly reflect the evolving urban area,  cultural heritage and sustainability.  The growth management rating of objectives was discussed together  with the alignment with the growth plan of the Region, the five year  review to demonstrate achievement of the intensification targets and  employment goals. The overall intensification target rests with the  Region of Durham in conjunction with ROPA 128.  R. Petrie, Chief Administrative Officer, advised that all input and  comments will be taken into consideration for future recommendations  to the OP Review. It was directed that staff incorporate a glossary of  terms into the Official Plan Review for ease of reference.

Ms. Massey advised that as a result  of the final configuration of the Highway 407 lands for Ministry of  Transportation use, a small and oddly configured piece of land remains,  with limited access and visibility to the property.  She expressed concern  with conformity to the Region of Durham Official Plan; potential Regional  Centre areas; and Provincial Policy Statements (PPS) dealing with  employments lands and the future conversion of these lands, as it is her  understanding there must be consistency with these plans as well as the  Brooklin Secondary Plan. Written correspondence from Ms. Massey  dated April 29, 2013 with respect to this matter was provided to all  Members of Council.  Page 2 of 5  Special Council Minutes   April 29, 2013 -6:00 PM    Questions were posed regarding the monitoring and implementation  process of the plan. The consultant advised that sustainability  strategies, standards and guidelines, performance checklists; and  impact assessments for long term monitoring will be included in the  process.  Further discussion ensued with respect to future growth in the area;  protecting industrial lands from conversion and defining what is  considered appropriate in terms of other land conversion.  There was  discussion surrounding the word \"compact\" in relation to neighbourhood  planning, in that the OP works to create density, not necessarily  compact neighbourhoods. There was discussion surrounding the  terminology of \"appropriate\" growth management, as growth should be  balanced and phased. It was suggested that design guidelines and  standards for neighbourhoods should be considered as part of the  Official Plan Review.     Resolution No. 194-13    Moved By Mayor Perkins    1. That Planning Report Item No. PL 45-13 be received for information;  2. That the Planning Department report back to the Council in  Committee of the Whole regarding a recommended Official Plan  Amendment following the consideration of input from the public,  commenting agencies and departments.    SEE FOLLOWING MOTION    Resolution No. 195-13    Moved By Mayor Perkins     That the following be added as Items 2 and 3 and that the main motion  be renumbered accordingly:  1. That in relation to Item 2.3.3.1 f) of the Proposed Draft Amendment  to the Whitby Official Plan, alternate wording be sought to the word  \"appropriately\" and replaced as necessary;  2. That in relation to Item 2.3.4.2 b) of the Proposed Draft Amendment  to the Whitby Official Plan alternate wording be sought to the word  \"compact\" and replaced as necessary; and  3. That the correspondence from Madison Properties be referred to  staff.

Mayor Perkins noted that the purpose of the meeting was for an Education and Training Session as provided by the Chief Administrative Officer and in accordance with the Municipal Act and Procedural By-law 6125-08, there would be no decisions made by Council at this meeting. 2. Presentation and Overview by the CAO with respect to follow-up to the November 1, 2011 Special Council \u2013 Education & Training Session - R. Petrie, Chief Administrative Officer provided handouts to Members of Council, and provided an overview in this regard. He noted that he had come to the conclusion that despite the Community Strategic Plan (CSP) being out of date, it in fact mirrors closely to the Regional Strategic Plan and the four pillars of sustainability. He noted that there was concern from a staff level that due to the number of projects on the go, that another community consultation process would be too much for the public and so determined at the last meeting to complete an update only of the plan. He indicated that key elements of the CSP would be establishing the benchmarks to determine where you are at, where Council wants to get to and where it matches with the CSP.  MINUTES OF THE SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY HELD ON MONDAY, JANUARY 11, 2012 AT 6:00 PM AT THE REGAL ROOM, CENTENNIAL BUILDING He advised that the first thing to do is to try and identify what we do and what part of the strategic plan these things fulfill, define the objectives to what we are doing in terms of the objective of the CSP ie: business plan is in line with the CSP. In summary, he noted that the end result would be that he would come back with a revised corporate strategic plan, and attached to this plan would be a business plan that specifically says that over the next four years this is what we are going to do, noting that timelines would be established as well. A detailed question and answer period ensued. 3. ADJOURNMENT MOVED by Councillor Coe Seconded by Councillor Emm That the meeting be adjourned. CARRIED The meeting adjourned at 9:15 p.m. Debi A.

Mr. Sanderson referred to a report by Ed Clark, Chair  of the Advisory Council on Government Assets from October 17, 2014.   Mr. Sanderson explained that the report's focus was on making Ontario  assets work better for taxpayers and consumers.  In looking at reducing  the cost of electricity distribution, consideration was given to whether the  reduction of smaller utility companies that serve few customers could be  serviced by piecing out a larger utility such as Hydro One.  He stated  that the Advisory Council recommendations were not to piece apart  Hydro One but that the distribution side could be reduced which would  free up money that could be utilized for growing infrastructure needs in  the Province.  Mr. Sanderson stated that the actions coming out of the report were not  certain and that the Whitby Hydro Board was keeping a close eye on  this.  He advised Members of Council that the Board was looking at  getting a current assessment of Whitby Hydro and that they would be  undertaking a strategic planning session.   A brief question and answer period ensued.  It was requested that Mr.  Sanderson compile the details and provide recommendations and  options to Council which could be used to evaluate and assess the  situation prior to moving forward.

Belsey, Manager, Long Range Planning, appeared before Council  and provided an overview of the report and the Official Plan Amendment  process undertaken thus far.  Mr. Belsey advised that staff are ready to  move forward with the review and have brought forward the propsed  draft amendments for Council's consideration noting that the next public  meeting is scheduled for April 29, 2013.  A detailed question and answer period ensued about the timing of the  adoption of the proposed Official Plan Amendment in accordance with  the Official Plan Review being undertaken by the Province. Mr. Belsey  advised Council that once the Provincial review has been completed,  there would be opportunity for the Town to revisit the Official Plan in  consideraton of any recommendations that may arise from the Province.  Questions were also raised regarding the section of the proposed plan  dealing with housing needs.  Discussion ensued with regard to the use  of the word 'support' that is mentioned throughout the report in relation  to housing needs.  Council encouraged staff to look at other words that  may have the same context and meaning such as 'encourage' or  'promote' so that there would be no confusion that the support is in any  way interpreted as financial support.  It was further noted that the role of  the Town regarding housing needs is purely for land designation and  zoning purposes and not for monetary or financial support.  Council  further stated  that staff should look at having more rigorous  conversations with the Region regarding the Social Housing Plans that  are in place as the Town would have to conform to the housing  plans adopted by Regional Council.  Further discussion ensued with regard to intensification and it was noted  that the Regional Plan does not support intensification in stable  residential areas.    Moved By Councillor Coe    1. That Planning Report Item No. PL 30-13 be received for information;  2.

CARRIED 3.1 Re: Planning Department Report, PL 09-10 Intensification Strategy \u2013 Whitby Official Plan Review \u2013 Public Meeting (OPA-2009-W/02)  MINUTES OF THE SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY HELD ON THURSDAY, MARCH 18, 2010 AT THE HOUR OF 7:00 P.M. IN THE MEETING HALL OF THE WHITBY MUNICIPAL BUILDING AS CALLED BY THE HEAD OF COUNCIL R. Short, Director of Planning, introduced the report. Chair Coe declared the meeting to be a public meeting and invited submissions from the audience. Dr. Dan Betterinski, 120 Cashay Drive, Brooklin, appeared before Committee and advised he is concerned that the areas of intensification identified in the report have already been developed and yet there are a number of areas not developed in Town and it appears they have not been considered. He also expressed concerns about the potential loss of soccer pitches, recreational areas and heritage elements in order to put up high rises to meet the intensification objectives. Stan Aveltowics, 107 Wellington Street, appeared before Committee and stated that he understood that intensification was required, noting that a balance of being able to live, work and shop was important. He noted that Whitby had a lot of commuters to Toronto, who also spend their money in Toronto which is a missed opportunity. In summary he stated that when reviewing intensification, could there be a concentration on areas to make it a true place to live, work and shop right in the community. He further advised that all parks should be left alone. Doug Anderson, Whitby resident, appeared before Committee and provided a detailed powerpoint presentation. He stated that he resided in Olde Whitby and intensification was a threat to this area. He provided an overview of past planning within the Town and felt that there was a disconnect between residential and commercial development. He advised that development should have height, rather than single storeys with wide open parking lots. In summary, he stated that the Town needed to change the perception of developable lands. Mike Baber, 408 Brock Street North, appeared before Committee and indicated that he was glad to see the provincial reports, such as the Places to Grow as it helped to move forward development within parameters. Mr. Baber concurs with previous speakers about the need for mixed and residential uses in order to meet intensification. He expressed appreciation for a very comprehensive report from Planning staff and emphasized that the Town has to be proactive in developing policy. He further advised that a peer review process should be utilized when developing a large project. He is encouraged by the idea of developing a pedestrian-friendly environment and embracing the concept of urban design. He expressed concern with the Eco-place development as the presentation at the previous meeting was very poor and they should obtain the services of an architect, rather than copying from another project. He noted that the soccer fields' needs to be redesigned as they have great potential and should be used for multi-use  MINUTES OF THE SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY HELD ON THURSDAY, MARCH 18, 2010 AT THE HOUR OF 7:00 P.M. IN THE MEETING HALL OF THE WHITBY MUNICIPAL BUILDING AS CALLED BY THE HEAD OF COUNCIL Francesco Nino, 10 Regatta Drive, advised many concerns had already been expressed tonight by previous speakers. He stated that the mandate to intensify should not be considered a problem, but rather an opportunity, especially in the Port Whitby area. He noted that the combination of live/work spaces that allow employment in the same area is key for residents. The Town needs to attract the high paying employment that provides for these opportunities. He further advised that a well planned development can become the focal point of the Town of Whitby right on the waterfront and this in turn will create employment opportunities. Andy Belick, 7 Billings Street, appeared before Committee and noted that his neighbourhood had a very active social network who have discussed this matter and understand that intensification is coming and generally support it. He advised that in supporting intensification it should be done equitability throughout the town, noting that it can take on many forms. He further advised that there is no need for high rises unless non-developed. He indicated that thoughtfulness in development, transitions in development and thinking of the big picture are essential. In summary he advised that there should be smooth transition of the development areas. Nancy Shanks, Whitby resident questioned if Camp X and Intrepid Park would be protected? She advised that she would prefer to see all plans on one map overlaid so that they can determine what it is going to look like and questioned if developers can be forced to go beyond minimum code? She questioned the amount of public access to the lakefront and if development with a mixed use was being considered. Joseph Ieraci, 228 Wellington Street, stated that he would like to see intensification in the downtown area only, specifically near four corners of downtown. He further noted that there were lots of places along main corridors that would benefit from intensification. Thomas Dawson, 22 Eva Court, appeared before Committee, and requested clarification on the status of a property south of Burns, east of Garden. Staff provided clarification on this specific item, noting that applicant had the right to participate in this process just as the other members of the public does. There being no further submissions from the public, Chair Coe closed the public meeting. RESOLUTION NO. 91-10 MOVED by Mayor Perkins 1.

Carried    7.19 Bill 68, Modernizing Ontario's Municipal Legislation, 2016      Resolution # 44-17    Moved By Councillor Leahy  Seconded By Councillor Emm    Whereas Bill 68, Modernizing Ontario's Municipal Legislation, 2016  received first reading on November 16, 2016;     And Whereas the Council of the Town of Whitby applauds many of the  proposed amendments but continues to encourage revisions or  consideration of other amendments necessary for municipal operations  and financial sustainability that are not included in Bill 68;      Now Therefore Be It Resolved:     1. That the following proposed amendments to the Municipal Act  and Municipal Conflict of Interest Act to clarify and broaden the  powers granted to municipalities be applauded:  a) Providing a clear and concise definition of what constitutes a  'meeting';  b) Expanding the number of discretionary exemptions for entering  into a closed meeting to consider confidential information;  c) Giving Integrity Commissioners the power to self-initiate  investigations and provide advice to councils and local boards  about their codes of conduct and Municipal Conflict of Interest Act  (MCIA) obligations;    d) Inclusion of a statement of principle in the MCIA and a broader  range of penalties for members found to be in contravention.  2. That given the recent changes to the Municipal Elections Act to  ban corporate and union donations, in conjunction with proposed  changes to limit the self-financing of campaigns, the Province be  encouraged to:  a) Investigate ways to ensure a level playing field between  incumbents and challengers;  Page 15 of 24  Regular Council Minutes   January 30, 2017 - 7:00 PM    b) Determine ways that the Province and municipalities can assist  in educating and informing voters to increase awareness and  turnout.  3. That the following proposed amendments to the Municipal Act  and Municipal Conflict of Interest Act be further considered for the  purpose of ensuring clarity and preventing unintended  consequences:  a) The proposed discretionary exemption to allow consideration  of \"certain third party information supplied in confidence\" in a  closed meeting should be clarified, by further defining 'third party  information' and 'supplied in confidence';  b) The proposed amendment to the MCIA that would allow a  'person', which could include a non-resident, corporation or  municipality to apply to a judge for determination on whether a  member violated the MCIA, be removed in favour of the existing  requirement that only an 'elector' can apply for such  determination  c) The Town opposes the proposal to allow an Integrity  Commissioner to make an application to court for a judicial  decision on whether a Member of Council has violated the MCIA,  given the untenable position this would place the Integrity  Commissioner and municipality; this could be further exacerbated  by the potential for the court to rule in the Member's favour which  would result in the municipality paying for both the Integrity  Commissioner to bring the court application and to defend the  court application for the Member as per the Town's  Indemnification By-law.   4. That this Council supports the Association of Municipalities of  Ontario in its work to close the fiscal gap; so that all municipalities  can benefit from predictable and sustainable revenue, to finance  the pressing infrastructure and municipal service needs faced by  all municipal governments; and,  That the following amendments not proposed through Bill 68 be  given further consideration and be incorporated with the  proposed legislative changes:  a) The additional revenue and taxation powers granted to the City  of Toronto, such as the land transfer tax, should be expanded to  all municipalities given the unsustainable nature of supporting  municipal services primarily from revenue generated through the  property tax levy.  5. That the above resolution and the Memorandum from the  Commissioner of Legal and By-law Services dated January 23,  2017 be circulated to the Association of Municipality of Ontario,  Area Municipalities, Minister of Municipal Affairs and local MPP.

Carried  9.  Notice of Motion    9.1  There were no notices of motion.    10.  New and Unfinished Business    10.1 The Charter for Inclusive Communities      Resolution # 46-17    Moved By Councillor Gleed  Seconded By Councillor Yamada    Whereas the Charter for Inclusive Communities affirms the dignity of  every person and calls for a concerted effort to counter prejudice and  hate and to develop programs and policies specific to the reduction and  elimination of Islamophobia in all its forms.    And Whereas the rise of anti-Muslim incidents across Canada and the  recent attacks in Quebec City risk eroding the strength of our country's  rich social fabric;    Now therefore be it resolved that Whitby Town Council endorses and  supports the National Council of Canadian Muslims' Charter for  Page 17 of 24  Regular Council Minutes   January 30, 2017 - 7:00 PM    Inclusive Communities which reads:    \"Preamble    The recent rise in anti-Muslim incidents in Canada is disturbing and risks  eroding the strength of our country's rich social fabric. When Muslim  women are attacked in the streets, when mosques are vandalized or  when people face prejudice in their workplace or school, it is not only  Canadian Muslims that suffer; Canadian society as a whole is weakened  because our values of equality, respect, justice and dignity for all are  threatened.    Hate crimes against Muslims have risen dramatically in recent years  both in Canada, and around the world. Given the unfortunate climate of  fear that seems to have entered some segments of public life, it appears  that this trend is increasing.    Islamophobia is real and it is wrong, despite what some may say to  downplay it or dismiss it. This type of hate and discrimination tells  Canadian Muslims that they do not belong by isolating them and their  communities through stigmatization and casting them as outsiders and  the 'other'.    Our Commitment    By signing this Charter, we commit to standing up for the rights and  dignity of everyone in order to promote inclusive, just, and respectful  communities in Canada.    We strongly affirm that:  \uf0b7 Islamophobia, like all other forms of racism, hate, xenophobia,  and bigotry, has no place in Canadian society.  \uf0b7 Discrimination and acts of hate against anyone, marginalize  individuals and communities and exclude them from participating  fully in society and fulfilling their potential.  \uf0b7 The dignity of every person in Canada is essential to a healthy  and vibrant society.  \uf0b7 Everyone in Canada has a role to play in creating safe  environments for us all.  \uf0b7 All levels of government, civil society, communities, and public  officials have a duty to work together in developing policies,  programs and initiatives to reduce and eliminate Islamophobia in  all of its forms.  \uf0b7 By working together, we can nurture inclusive communities and  Page 18 of 24  Regular Council Minutes   January 30, 2017 - 7:00 PM    strengthen our shared commitment to Canada's values of  equality, respect, justice, and the dignity of all persons.\"    And That this resolution be forwarded to the local Member of Parliament  (M.P.), the local Member of Provincial Parliament (M.P.P.), the  Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO), the Federation of  Canadian Municipalities (FCM), the Town of Whitby's Ethno-Cultural  and Diversity Advisory Committee, the Regional Municipality of Durham  and all Durham Region Municipalities.     Carried unanimously on a recorded vote as follows:      For  Against  Abstained  Councillor Joe Drumm  x      Councillor Michael Emm  x      Councillor Derrick Gleed  x      Councillor Chris Leahy  x      Councillor Rhonda Mulcahy  x      Councillor Elizabeth Roy  x      Councillor Steve Yamada  x      Mayor Don Mitchell  x        8  0  0    Resolution # 47-17    Moved By Councillor Emm  Seconded By Councillor Roy    That the flags at all Town facilities be lowered to half-mast in recognition  of the mosque attacks that occurred in Quebec City.     Carried    Resolution # 48-17    Moved By Councillor Roy  Seconded By Councillor Mulcahy    That a motion to introduce a matter pertaining to the ACS Alcolock  Systems be allowed due to it timely and urgent nature.    Carried on a Two Third Vote  Page 19 of 24  Regular Council Minutes   January 30, 2017 - 7:00 PM      10.2 ACS Alcolock System      Resolution # 49-17    Moved By Councillor Roy  Seconded By Councillor Mulcahy    Whereas the Town of Whitby strives to be a leader in its support for  proactive measures that can reduce the risks associated with drinking  and driving;      Whereas while there has been increased levels of enforcement,  education and awareness about not drinking and driving, more needs to  be done to address growing concerns related to drinking and driving and  the morning after effects by responsible drinkers who take appropriate  steps when leaving a bar via a designated driver or similar such  programs and show up for work the next day, unaware that they  continue to have levels of alcohol in their system;      Whereas countries such as France, Finland, Norway, Sweden and  others have implemented or are in the process of implementing  legislation requiring all vehicles that transport people or are contracted  by various levels of government that interact in the public realm must  have a proactive Alcohol Countermeasure System installed on vehicles;       Whereas equipment such as the ACS Alcolock System provides  safeguards that will prevent and alert an operator of a vehicle if their  blood alcohol level is too high and that they and the public may be at  risk; and,     Whereas installation of such devices not only improves public safety, but  may also reduce the cost of fleet insurance policies.     Now Therefore be it Resolved:     That the Town of Whitby request the Province of Ontario to implement  legislation that will require operators of public transportation vehicles to  have installed devices that will proactively prevent the risks associated  with high blood alcohol levels the morning after drinking; and,     That the Clerk forward copies of this motion to Minister of  Transportation, GTA Municipalities, Metrolinx, The Honourable Lorne  Coe, the Durham Public and Separate School Boards, the Conseil  Page 20 of 24  Regular Council Minutes   January 30, 2017 - 7:00 PM    scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud and Conseil scolaire  Viamonde.    Carried unanimously on a recorded vote as follows:      For  Against  Abstained  Councillor Joe Drumm  x      Councillor Michael Emm  x      Councillor Derrick Gleed  x      Councillor Chris Leahy  x      Councillor Rhonda Mulcahy  x      Councillor Elizabeth Roy  x      Councillor Steve Yamada  x      Mayor Don Mitchell  x        8  0  0    10.3 Highways 412 Toll Routes  Councillor Gleed raised the matter of the correspondence that was sent  to the Ministry of Transportation regarding the tolling of Highway 412  and advised that a response had been received from the Ministry  acknowledging the Town's letter and advising that the Highway would  continue to be a tolled road.  Councillor Gleed made reference to the  initial communications and RFPs pertaining to the establishment of the  Highway and noted that they did not indicate a toll route for the Highway  at that time.  He further advised that thousands of residents had signed  a petition against the tolls on Highway 412 and that hopefully in time, the  Province would see the need to eliminate the tolls.  A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Council and staff regarding:  \uf0b7 when the eastbound ramps on Lakeridge Road would be opened;  \uf0b7 whether there would be measures in place to track the traffic  volumes on Lakeridge Road once the Hwy 412 tolls commenced  on February 1, 2017; and,  \uf0b7 the need to have a base line of data to provide for future traffic  statistics and the ability to measure the long term impacts.  Council heard Item 1, Declarations of Pecuniary Interest at this time.    11.
