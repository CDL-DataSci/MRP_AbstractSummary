{"text": "Minutes of the 9th Meeting  Committee of Adjustment      Meeting Date:   Thursday, September 19, 2024  Meeting Time:  7:00 p.m.  Meeting Location:  Virtual Meeting    Present:  S. Haslam, Chair  J. Cardwell  N. Chornobay   K. Docherty  J. Rinella  R. Chow, Secretary-Treasurer  J. Malfara, (Acting) Supervisor, Zoning & Regulation  Item 1:  Land Acknowledgement    The chair opened the meeting and made the land acknowledgement  statement.  Item 2:  Disclosure of Interest:  There was no disclosure of interest by the members of the Committee of  Adjustment.  Carried   Item 3:  Public Hearings    A/37/24  TH (Brooklin) Developments   6760 Baldwin St N   An application has been received from TH (Brooklin) Developments for a variance from  the provisions of Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  The application is for permission to reduce the minimum required exterior side yard  setback from 3.0 m to 1.4 m for 3 structures identified on the submitted site plan.    The requested variance is required to permit a proposed development for 208 back-to- back townhouse dwellings as previously recommended through Site Plan SP-03-23.  The subject property is zoned Medium Density Residential (MD) within the Town of  Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  In Support of Application:    Matthew Cory (Applicant/Owner Representative)  In Opposition of Application:   None at this time.   The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.   M. Cory introduced himself as a Planner at Malone Given Parsons (MGP), representing  the applicant and owner. M. Cory provided an overview of the requested variance and  stated that the application to permit a reduced exterior side yard setback for back-to- back townhouses on a portion of the subject lands is part of larger development  approval for the former Brooklin Concrete site.   M. Cory explained that the Region requires a common water meter room for  townhouses located on common element roadways. In accordance with the proposed  site configuration, this meter would encroach into an exterior side yard for one of the  proposed townhouse blocks. The meter room would not occupy the full width of the  exterior side wall, so sightlines would not be negatively impacted.   M. Cory further stated that the repositioning of the townhouse blocks to add walkways to  the site also resulted in a reduced exterior side yard setback for two townhouse blocks.  A sightline analysis was conducted to demonstrate that there would be no significant  impacts to visibility from these reduced setbacks.    Minutes of the 9th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   M. Cory addressed correspondence received from a resident on Camber Ct regarding  concerns of increased density in the area due to the redevelopment of the Brooklin  Concrete site. M. Cory stated that the townhouses would be internal to the site and that  lower-density single-detached dwellings would be built adjacent to Camber Ct to provide  for a buffer and transition of density between the new developments and established  low-density neighbourhoods. M. Cory also noted that the proposed single-detached  dwellings will not have any vehicular access to Camber Ct.  M. Cory concluded by stating that the requested minor variance meets the 4 tests as set  out by the Planning Act.   The Chair asked the Secretary-Treasurer if Planning Staff had any concerns regarding  an amendment to original variance (1.4 m exterior side yard setback) to 0.7 m.   The Secretary-Treasurer stated that Planning Staff reviewed the amendment to the  application and had no objection. The reduced setback would be internal to the site and  would not be expected to cause significant visibility issues.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.   N. Chornobay asked for confirmation on if the subject property was part of a registered  plan of subdivision and if it was subject to an approved site-specific Zoning By-law.  M. Cory stated that the subject lands are not yet part of a registered plan of subdivision.  A site-specific Zoning has been approved and the plan would be proceeding to  registration shortly.   N. Chornobay asked what the process would be for the sale of the townhouse units to  commence.  M. Cory stated that since draft plan approval has been granted, the sale of lots is  currently permitted.   N. Chornobay stated that there were concerns raised by existing residents to the west  of the development who may be interested in the current status of the development.   M. Cory explained that he has been the Planner working on this development since the  original development application was proposed and submitted to the Town. In response  to feedback from the residents living along Camber Ct, no lots are proposed to front  Camber Ct. M. Cory stated that this minor variance application will not affect these lots.  K. Docherty asked for the depth and width of the lots backing on Camber Ct.  M. Cory stated that the lots will generally be approximately 11.6 m wide and  approximately 30 m deep.   There were no further questions from the Committee.    Minutes of the 9th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   The Chair asked the Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been received in  relation to the subject application.  The Secretary-Treasurer advised the Committee that 1 letter of objection was received  and that it had been circulated to the Committee for their review.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.   There was no one.  N. Chornobay asked if the amendment to the variance for a 0.7 m exterior side yard  setback would apply to the entire site or only to the specific area with a meter room.  The Secretary-Treasurer responded that the variance is tied to the structures indicated  in the submitted site plant therefore if approved, a 0.7 m exterior side yard setback  would be the minimum requirement only for the 3 structures identified. A 0.7 m exterior  side yard setback is only proposed for 1 townhouse block with the meter room. The  other 2 townhouse blocks seeking relief will have an exterior side yard setback ranging  between 1.7 m and 2.2 m.  Moved by: J. Cardwell  That the application be amended, as requested by the applicant, to permit an exterior  side yard setback of 0.7 m for the structures identified in the submitted site plan.  Carried  Moved by: J. Rinella.   That the application to reduce the minimum required exterior side yard from 3.0 m to 0.7  m for the structures identified in the submitted site plan located at 6760 Baldwin St N be  Granted.  Carried  Reason:     The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variance is minor in nature;  that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the Official Plan is being  maintained, and that the granting of the application is desirable and would result in the  appropriate development of the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.       Minutes of the 9th Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   A/40/24  Jonathan Benczkowski  303 Green St   An application has been received from Jonathan Benczkowski (on behalf of Swarn &  Harmesh Dhonsi) for variances from the provisions of Town of Whitby Zoning By-law  2585.  The application is for permission to (1) reduce the minimum required lot area for an  apartment dwelling from 135 m2/unit to 128 m2/unit, and (2) reduce the minimum  required private amenity space from 9 m2/unit to 0 m2/unit for 1 unit.

In Support of Application:   Jonathan Benczkowski (Applicant/Owner  Representative)  In Opposition of Application:   None at this time.   The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.   J. Benczkowski introduced himself as a Planner at Sol-Arch representing the owner. J.  Benczkowski provided a brief overview of the proposal and of the requested variances.  J. Benczkowski stated that since the new apartment unit would be entirely located within  the basement of the existing apartment building, there would be no alterations to the  exterior of the building, the parking area, or the landscaping of the site.   The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.   J. Cardwell asked if permits would be required for heating and ventilation changes.  J. Benczkowski responded that a Building Permit would be required for the plumbing  and mechanical systems.   J. Cardwell asked how the proposed unit would be accessed.  J. Benzkowski stated that the unit would only be accessed internally through the  basement, and that no new exterior entrances would be constructed.  There were no further questions from the Committee.   The Chair asked the Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been received in  relation to the subject application.

Wenda Abel, Resident, noted elements of the proposed building design  such as commercial amenities and features that support environmental  sustainability, including the green roof design. Ms. Abel raised concerns  regarding the height and density of the proposed building, as well as the  impact on traffic, pedestrian safety, and walkability in surrounding  neighbourhoods. She stated that the proposed development will increase  traffic congestion on Victoria Street and surrounding neighbourhoods,  which already experience high traffic volumes due to proximity to Highway  401, the waterfront, and other amenities. Ms. Abel further stated that  modes of active transportation such as walking and cycling were not  feasible to Taunton Road and would lead to future residents using  vehicles and adding to traffic congestion in the area. Ms. Abel raised  concerns regarding the displacement of current tenants, including the  potential financial impact on those being displaced. She requested that the  proposed building design include a reasonable number of affordable rental  units, and suggested that the Town support the current tenants in finding  new lodging and affordable housing. Ms. Abel recommended that future  development and intensification must consider the wellbeing of residents  and affordability.  Sam Mercado, owner of the subject lands, answered questions regarding:  \uf0b7 the design of the building to address issues of human scale and  experience;  \uf0b7 whether the height of the building meets the current maximum  designation of 18 storeys;  \uf0b7 design elements that would support modes of active transportation,  such as cycling, in order to mitigate increased traffic concerns; and,  \uf0b7 communicating with tenants through the site superintendents.  Marilynn Hall, Resident, stated that the residents of 110 Victoria Street  West did not receive any communication regarding the applications or the  impact on current tenants. Ms. Hall raised concerns regarding existing  traffic conditions and density on Victoria Street. She raised additional  concerns regarding financial burdens associated with relocating long-term  tenants.  Staff answered questions regarding:       3  \uf0b7 the current stage of the application process;  \uf0b7 legislated requirements for circulating and posting notifications  regarding the applications;  \uf0b7 responsibilities of the property owner to notify tenants; and,  \uf0b7 receiving notifications and updates by registering as an Interested  Party.

A detailed question and answer period between Members of  Committee and Staff regarding:  \uf0b7 the rationale for residents not being notified about Staff  report being presented at this meeting;  \uf0b7 the rationale for not engaging the City of Pickering for the  Highway 7/12 Alternative Route EA for a shared cost given  that the scope of work has expanded to include an alignment  of Whitby and Pickering roads;  \uf0b7 confirmation that the estimated cost to complete the  alternate route project was $155,000,000 and that       5  $87,000,000 was included until 2031 in the current the  Development Charge rates;  \uf0b7 confirmation that the funding of the project to date has been  through development charges;  \uf0b7 whether the reserve funds in the amount $255,000 for the  EA Study for Columbus Road were funded through  development charges or the tax base;  \uf0b7 the initial projected cost of the 7/12 Alternate Route EA  versus the budgeted amount not including the $255,000 for  the Columbus Road EA;  \uf0b7 whether a value was given to the 2.5 km of Baldwin Street  that the Town was seeking to assume care and control for;  \uf0b7 including new growth related projects in the Development  Charges Background Study should the project not continue;  \uf0b7 the potential impact on setbacks and the MTO requirements  around a road should the 7/12 alternate route not be  pursued;  \uf0b7 the status of the development located at Winchester Road  and Baldwin Street and whether the Town having care and  control of Baldwin Street would have had an impact on the  status of that development;  \uf0b7 the impact on the EA should consideration of the Staff report  be delayed until the fall;  \uf0b7 opportunities for the Town to assume care of control of  Baldwin Street;  \uf0b7 whether the Alternative F, Mid-Block and Thickson Road  was a viable preferred route option, and the rationale for  Alternative F not being the TPA;  \uf0b7 confirmation that Alternative B-R (Lake Ridge Road and  CPR rail corridor) was the TPA and whether this option  would be presented for public consultation in the fall;  \uf0b7 the impact of Bill 23 on development charges;       6  \uf0b7 the lack of support for an alternate route through the Oak  Ridges Moraine;  \uf0b7 the repercussions of terminating the project and the  available options should the project be terminated; and,  \uf0b7 partnering with the Region to explore routes outside of  Whitby's geographical boundaries, whether projects outside  of Town boundaries would qualify for utilizing development  charge funds, and the percentage of the TPA outside of  Whitby's boundaries.

Mr.  Laturski advised that during his youth, he was able to take  advantage of the amenities in the park, and that he spent a lot of  quality time playing soccer and basketball at the park with friends  and family. He stated that he was advocating for the same  opportunities for the children in the area to take advantage of  equipment and/or amenities that should be accessible to them. He  stated that there was no reason for the removal of the basketball  net and to deprive the children in the neighbourhood from  participating in constructive recreation. Mr. Laturski stated that he  would like to see the reinstalment of the basketball net as soon as  possible.    A question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Mr. Laturski regarding whether the delegate had  any previous concerns when the basketball net was in the court  and where the delegate resides in relation to Forest Heights Park.  6.2.2 Bill Geraghty, Resident (In-Person Attendance)  Re: Forest Heights Park Basketball Court    Refer to Item 6.5.2, Forest Heights Park Basketball Court  Bill Geraghty, Resident, appeared before the Committee and stated  that he has resided in Whitby for 16 years. He advised that, despite  community consultation, the basketball net was removed due to  complaints which resulted in an overwhelming response from the  public for the basketball net to be reinstalled. He advised that, as  an advocate for the physical, social, and emotional well-being of  children, he was in favour of reinstalling the basketball net to allow  the youth to enjoy the numerous benefits of outdoor play, team  sports, social engagement, community building, and celebrating  diversity and inclusivity. Mr. Geraghty stated that reinstalling the net  would provide children the opportunity to engage in a physically  demanding sport that promotes cardiovascular fitness, agility,       10  coordination, and overall physical well-being. He indicated that by  participating in basketball, children would develop crucial motor  skills, enhance their flexibility, and build strength necessary for a  healthy lifestyle. Mr. Geraghty advised that playing basketball  fosters the values of teamwork, cooperation, and communication,  and that reinstalling the basketball net would create an environment  where children learn to work together, trust their teammates, and  understand the significance of collaboration. He noted that the  bonds formed on the court extend beyond the game to build lifelong  friendships, and valuable social skills. Mr. Geraghty stated that the  sport of basketball embraces all who wish to participate regardless  of race, gender, or socioeconomic background, and that reinstalling  the net would also serve as a catalyst for community involvement  and encourage community members to come together and support  youth to create a safe and inclusive space for everyone.   A question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Mr. Geraghty regarding:  \uf0b7 where the delegate resides in relation to the location of the  basketball court/net;  \uf0b7 whether the delegate's daughter previously had access to  the basketball net; and,  \uf0b7 whether there were any negative events experienced by the  delegate prior to the basketball net being removed.  It was the consensus of the Committee to hear Item 6.5.2, Forest  Hill Park Basketball Court, at this time.  6.2.3 Aleem Kanji, Chief Advocacy Officer, Canadian National Fireworks  Association (Virtual Attendance)  Re: FES 04-23, Fire and Emergency Services Department Report  Report and Recommendations of Changes to the By-law to  Regulate the Sales and Discharge of Fireworks  Refer to Item 6.4.6, FES 04-23  Aleem Kanji, Chief Advocacy Officer, Canadian National Fireworks  Association (CFNA), stated that the association was established in  2013, and that he advocates on behalf of 3000 members of the  fireworks industry to promote fair access and safety in the sale and  use of fireworks. He advised that he works with all levels of       11  government to create improvements within the fireworks industry  through the association's Vendor Certification and Employee  Training program which was used in municipalities across Canada.  Mr. Kanji stated that both the industry and the government must  accept responsibility to create education programs, vendor  certification, and training advocacy for users. He noted that the  Staff Report proposes prohibiting the possession, sale, and  discharge of all consumer fireworks in Whitby. Mr. Kanji advised  that there were extensive regulatory licensing and safety measures  in place for all vendors who sell fireworks, noting that vendors who  sell and display fireworks must be licensed by the Federal  Government and must follow stringent rules. He stated that the  measures protect residents, the public and vendors. Mr. Kanji  stated that any municipality that bans fireworks was willingly  removing themselves from the established federal regulations, the  provincial fire code, municipal regulations, and the established  framework that was meant to protect residents. He advised that  consumers would continue to seek out ways to acquire fireworks  given the significance that fireworks play in religious, cultural, and  other significant events such as Canada Day and Diwali. Mr. Kanji  requested that Staff work with the industry to prepare a fulsome  report, and to bring forward a by-law that would have multi- stakeholder engagement including residents and the fireworks  industry. He stated that he was willing to work with Staff to include  the CNFA's education and training programs, at no cost to the  municipality, into a revised by-law that would continue to protect the  residents of Whitby. Mr. Kanji stated that in his experience a  complete ban of consumer grade fireworks was unenforceable and  would not be adhered to by the residents in Whitby.  A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Mr. Kanji regarding how the CNFA works with other  municipalities to address concerns about consumer grade  fireworks.  6.2.4 Tom Jacobs representing Rocket Fireworks Inc. (Virtual  Attendance)  Re: FES 04-23, Fire and Emergency Services Department Report  Report and Recommendations of Changes to the By-law to  Regulate the Sales and Discharge of Fireworks       12    Refer to Item 6.4.6, FES 04-23  Tom Jacobs, representing Rocket Fireworks Inc., stated that had  he not been part of fireworks industry he likely would not have  known about this meeting. Mr. Jacobs noted that sometimes things  like fireworks that people enjoy get quietly taken away due to a few  vocal complainants. He advised that the complaints about fireworks  were exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic because people  were starved for entertainment, noting that the sale of consumer  grade fireworks has since declined. He requested that fireworks not  be banned because of a few irresponsible residents when there  was a silent majority that use them responsibly. Mr. Jacobs advised  that his clients were mostly families, and that there were only a few  occasions per year when neighbouring families and streets gather  together to celebrate as a community. He stated that a ban in  Whitby would not stop the sale or use of fireworks and that  fireworks would be obtained and used illegally from vendors without  licences, online shopping or from merchants in neighbouring  municipalities. Mr. Jacobs stated that there would not be any  chance of safety, education, or responsible use. Mr. Jacobs noted  that the permanent vendors were long-term stakeholders who  educate customers on safe and responsible use. He requested that  Staff work with the industry and the CFNA's policies and  regulations that would curb unwanted behaviour, promote the \"Be a  Good Neighbour\" program, and allow the CFNA to certify temporary  retailers so they would be educated and informed about fireworks  and pass on the knowledge to consumers.  6.2.5 Abhi Singh, Resident (In-Person Attendance)  Re: FES 04-23, Fire and Emergency Services Department Report  Report and Recommendations of Changes to the By-law to  Regulate the Sales and Discharge of Fireworks    Refer to Item 6.4.6, FES 04-23  Abhi Singh, Resident, appeared before the Committee and stated  that he was advocating for the continuance of fireworks in Whitby.  He advised that fireworks have been a cherished tradition and  important part of celebrations for Diwali, New Years, Chinese New  Year, and Canada Day. Mr. Singh stated that many cultures look       13  forward to celebrating with fireworks because they symbolize good  over evil, but that more importantly fireworks celebrations were an  opportunity to make memories with family and bring communities  together. He stated that he understood the risks and challenges for  the Town, but that he would still like to have a legal way for people  to abide by the rules and be able to celebrate with fireworks. He  advised that he did not support discharging fireworks in the middle  of the night or creating a nuisance. Mr. Singh requested that the  Town provide a mechanism for the community to be able to  continue to use fireworks to celebrate, and to strengthen the rules  and procedures to address the concerns raised about noise and  safety.    A brief question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Mr. Singh regarding the importance/significance of  celebrating using fireworks to the delegate's culture, and the  preference of the delegate with respect to implementing a fee to  register to discharge fireworks versus not implementing a fee.  6.2.6 Dave Hodgson, Resident (In-Person Attendance)  Re: FES 04-23, Fire and Emergency Services Department Report  Report and Recommendations of Changes to the By-law to  Regulate the Sales and Discharge of Fireworks  Refer to Item 6.4.6, FES 04-23  Dave Hodgson, Resident, appeared before the Committee and  stated that he was a long-term resident in Whitby and that he  operates the Rocket Fireworks trailer on Thickson Road in Whitby.  He advised that a ban on consumer fireworks would directly affect  his and many families in the community. Mr. Hodgson stated that  fireworks have been used for a long time to celebrate special  occasions including Diwali, Victoria Day, Canada Day, and New  Years Eve. He further stated that to many people fireworks were  beloved traditions and that banning them would take away a big  part of their celebration and heritage. He noted that families unable  to attend the Town's events were able to participate in important  cultural celebrations and bring neighbours together through the use  of consumer fireworks. He requested that instead of banning the  private sale and display of fireworks that the Town keep the  industry safe with continued regulation and increased safety       14  awareness.     A question and answer period ensued between Members of  Committee and Mr. Hodgson regarding:  \uf0b7 the delegate's policy in educating the public when they  purchase fireworks;  \uf0b7 willingness to work with the CFNA to ensure people  purchasing fireworks received consistent information; and,  \uf0b7 whether the Town's regulations and policies were stricter  than those in other municipalities.  6.2.7 George Xidos representing Skylight Fireworks Inc. (Virtual  Attendance)  Re: FES 04-23, Fire and Emergency Services Department Report  Report and Recommendations of Changes to the By-law to  Regulate the Sales and Discharge of Fireworks  Refer to Item 6.4.6, FES 04-23  Mr. Xidos was not in attendance when called upon to provide a  delegation.  6.2.8 Shevonne Chin representing Flick Fireworks Inc. (In-Person  Attendance)  Re: FES 04-23, Fire and Emergency Services Department Report  Report and Recommendations of Changes to the By-law to  Regulate the Sales and Discharge of Fireworks  Refer to Item 6.4.6, FES 04-23  Shevonne Chin, representing Flick Fireworks Inc., suggested an  alternative to banning fireworks by designating a space for  fireworks which would have the potential to transform the multi- cultural Region of Durham and to be adapted into every city across  the province. The zone would be a space where individuals  celebrate themselves, friends and loved ones and/or significant  events every day of year without disturbing neighbours. Ms. Chin  advised that the zone would demonstrate inclusiveness, equality,  and diversity and would promote public safety with trained officials  on site to ensure responsible use, provide demonstrations, and to  assist as needed. Ms. Chin advised that by taking a proactive       15  approach and creating a controlled environment that celebrates the  diversity of the community there would be a reduction in the risk of  accidents, space would be provided for people who do not own  private property, and the use of illegal fireworks throughout the  Town would be alleviated. She stated that the economical potential  of designated fireworks zones was undeniable. Ms. Chin advised  that there was an opportunity to create a major tourist attraction in  Durham Region drawing visitors seeking the joy and excitement of  fireworks. Ms. Chin stated that this initiative would alleviate noise  disturbance complaints and reduce the burden on By-law  Enforcement Officers.  6.2.9 Tom Zacharias (In-Person Attendance) and Victor Chapnik (Virtual  Attendance) representing Kaboom Fireworks Inc.  Re: FES 04-23, Fire and Emergency Services Department Report  Report and Recommendations of Changes to the By-law to  Regulate the Sales and Discharge of Fireworks  Refer to Item 6.4.6, FES 04-23  Tom Zacharias, representing Kaboom Fireworks Inc., stated that for  over 10 years the company has been retailing low hazard  consumer fireworks in Whitby during the weeks preceding Victoria  Day and Canada Day. He advised that Kaboom Fireworks Inc.  distributes and oversees consumer fireworks programs during  those weeks in major big box retailers with stores in Whitby. He  noted that sales permits were obtained each season which includes  an on-site inspection as part of the process. Mr. Zacharias stated  that sales were conducted in accordance with by-laws and the  Federal Explosive Regulations which provide comprehensive  guidelines governing the display and sale of consumer fireworks.  He noted that among many requirements, the Federal guidelines  mandate a comprehensive and approved set of safety instructions  outlining the safe handling and discharge of fireworks which is  provided to every customer. Mr. Zacharias stated that Kaboom  Fireworks Inc. has hundreds of loyal customers in Whitby who look  forward to purchasing their consumer fireworks locally and who  operate safe fireworks displays with their families and communities.  He advised that Kaboom Fireworks Inc. in Ontario have fireworks  programs in over 130 municipalities which all continue to allow the  sale of consumer fireworks. He stated that the Staff report provided       16  a brief summary of 10 other municipal fireworks by-laws, noting that  almost all municipalities in Ontario permit the safe sale and use of  consumer fireworks. He advised that the Town of Caledon and City  of Brampton were the only municipalities that have recently  prohibited family fireworks which has not yet shown to decrease  fireworks related complaints. Mr. Zacharias stated that the City of  Mississauga undertook a comprehensive review of its fireworks by- law including engagement with the public and the fireworks industry  via surveys and meetings, noting that the recommended changes  would generally be restricted to an increase in education and  enforcement and that both sales and use would continue to be  permitted. Further, the City of Toronto conducted a similar review,  engagement process, and the outcome was similar to that of  Mississauga. Mr. Zacharias noted that the Town of Whitby's public  engagement included two surveys in 2022, noting that he did not  believe that the surveys were reflective of the broader Town  sentiment and that it did not appear that there was sufficient  awareness about the fireworks surveys among fireworks users or  the fireworks industry representatives. He noted that the COVID-19  pandemic provided a unique situation resulting in an increase in  sales and use including discharge on dates and in public locations  which were not permitted under the current by-law. Mr. Zacharias  stated that much of the use occurred at times when sales were  prohibited indicating a need for greater education and enforcement  as opposed to a prohibition. Mr. Zacharias stated that there would  be an increased need for police enforcement, a significant risk of  sales to minors, and an absence of safety instructions and  education provided to consumers should the Town not permit the  safe and regulated sale and use of consumer fireworks. He  indicated that a ban on consumer fireworks would not only be  disappointing, but that it would lead to diminished safety and  greater nuisance. Mr. Zacharias encouraged Members of Council to  consider further engagement with the fireworks industry and the  public with a focus on increasing education and enforcement of the  current by-law as opposed to a ban on consumer fireworks.  6.2.10 Lovedeep Grewal representing Phatboy Fireworks (Virtual  Attendance)  Re: FES 04-23, Fire and Emergency Services Department Report  Report and Recommendations of Changes to the By-law to       17  Regulate the Sales and Discharge of Fireworks    Refer to Item 6.4.6, FES 04-23  Lovedeep Grewal was not in attendance when called upon to  provide a delegation.

Haslam, Chair   J. Cardwell  N. Chornobay   K. Docherty  J. Rinella  R. Chow, Secretary-Treasurer  K. Kram, Senior Manager, Zoning & Regulation  J. Malfara, Principal Planner, Zoning & Regulation       Item 1:  Land Acknowledgement    The chair opened the meeting and made the land acknowledgement  statement.  Item 2:  Disclosure of Interest:  There was no disclosure of interest by the members of the Committee of  Adjustment.  Carried  Item 3:  Public Hearings    A/07/25  Jonas Munro  17 Mildenhall Pl   An application has been received from Jonas Munro for variances from the provisions of  Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.   The application is for permission to (1) increase the maximum permitted lot coverage  from 40% to 45% and (2) reduce the minimum required interior side yard setback of an  accessory structure from 0.6 m to 0.3 m.   The requested variance is required to permit a covered and unenclosed patio area  projecting from the rear of the existing dwelling, and to recognize an existing shed  located in the east interior side yard.   The subject property is located at 17 Mildenhall Pl and is zoned Residential (R2C*)  within Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  In Support of Application:    Jonas Munro (Owner/Applicant)  In Opposition of Application:   None at this time.   The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.   Jonas Munro introduced himself as the homeowner and provided a brief overview of the  requested variances. J. Munro stated that the proposed covered patio will increase the  lot coverage to 1% over the maximum permitted lot coverage. Following discussions  with Planning staff, he rounded up his request to permit up to 45% lot coverage for  future flexibility.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.   K. Docherty asked if the plans indicate a fireplace with an exterior vent located under  the proposed covered patio.  J. Munro stated that he will be removing the gas fireplace so that the proposed covered  patio does not have to impede on the fireplace's ventilation. In the future, he will install a  safer electric fireplace inside his house instead. J. Munro stated that the proposal will  meet the requirements of the Building Code.   J. Cardwell asked if the Building Division had any concerns with the existing shed  located in the side yard.   Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   J. Munro stated that the shed was installed approximately 5 years ago and did not  require a Building Permit. J. Munro further stated that he had discussed the shed with  his neighbour prior to its installation and his neighbour did not have any concerns.   J. Cardwell stated that the shed appears to be close to the lot line so eaves and a  downspout should be installed to direct any water away from the neighbouring property.  J. Munro responded that he will soon be re-shingling his house. The roofer will work on  improving the eaves on the house's roof and will also improve drainage and ventilation  for the shed.   There were no further questions from the Committee.   The Chair asked R. Chow, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  R. Chow advised the Committee that no correspondence was received.   The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.   There was no one.  Moved by: J. Cardwell   That the application to (1) increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 40% to  45% and (2) reduce the minimum required side yard setback of an accessory structure  from 0.6 m to 0.3 m located at 17 Mildenhall Pl be Granted subject to the following  condition:  1. Roof drainage and site grading shall not have a negative impact to adjacent  properties and shall conform to the requirements of the Engineering Services  Division.  Carried  Reason:     The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variances are minor in  nature; that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the Official Plan is being  maintained, and that the granting of the application is desirable and would result in the  appropriate development of the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.       Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment     A/08/25  Adrianna and Alfred Ramsingh    944 Dundas St E   An application has been received from Adrianna and Alfred Ramsingh for variances  from the provisions of Town of Whitby By-law 2585.   The application is for permission to (1) increase the maximum permitted height of a  dwelling from 8.5 m to 9.5 m, (2) to reduce the minimum required interior side yard  setback of a 2 storey dwelling from 2 m to 1.2 m for the east side yard, and (3) to  reduce the minimum required interior side yard setback for a side yard containing a  driveway where there is no garage on a lot from 4.3 m to 3.9 m for the west side yard.   The requested variances are required to permit a proposed single-detached dwelling  containing 3 additional dwelling units.  The subject property is located at 944 Dundas St E and is zoned Residential (R4) in  Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 2585.  In Support of Application:    None at this time.  In Opposition of Application:   None at this time.   The applicant was not present at this time.   N. Chornobay made a motion to move this item to the end of the meeting.   Carried.                                     Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   A/09/25  Jennifer Kitchen (Jenasys Drafting & Design)   25 Michael Blvd   An application has been received from Jennifer Kitchen of Jenasys Drafting & Design  (on behalf of Janis Chilton) for a variance from the provisions of Town of Whitby Zoning  By-law 2585.   The application is for permission to increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from  35% to 37%.   The requested variance is required to permit a proposed one-storey addition projection  from the rear wall of the existing single detached dwelling.  The subject property is located at 25 Michael Blvd and is zoned Residential (R2) within  Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 2585.  In Support of Application:    Jennifer Kitchen (Applicant)            Janis Chilton (Owner)  In Opposition of Application:   None at this time.   The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.   Jennifer Kitchen introduced herself as the applicant and designer representing the  homeowner, Janis Chilton. J. Kitchen provided a brief overview of the requested  variance and explained that the homeowner is seeking to build an addition to prepare  for barrier-free living and to make her home wheelchair accessible.    The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.   There were no questions from the Committee.   The Chair asked R. Chow, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  R. Chow advised the Committee that no correspondence was received.   The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.   There was no one.  Moved by: J. Rinella.   That the application to increase the maximum permitted lot coverage from 35% to 37%  located at 25 Michael Blvd be Granted subject to the following conditions:   Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   1. Roof drainage and site grading shall not have a negative impact to adjacent  properties and shall conform to the requirements of the Engineering Services  Division.   2. The Applicant shall apply for and obtain a Grading, Servicing, and Drainage  Permit through the Engineering Services Division.  Carried  Reason:     The members of the Committee were of the opinion that the variance is minor in nature;  that the general intent and purpose of the By-law and the Official Plan is being  maintained, and that the granting of the application is desirable and would result in the  appropriate development of the property.  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report and oral submissions  had an effect on the Committee's decision.                                                   Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   A/10/25  Richard Vink (VA3 Design Inc.)  30 McGowan Dr   An application has been received from Richard Vink of VA3 Design Inc. (on behalf of  3425 Coronation Developments Limited) for a variance from the provisions of Town of  Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.   The application is for permission to reduce the minimum required frontage for a single  detached dwelling containing an attached 2-car garage from 10.5 m to 9.6 m.   The requested variance is required to permit a proposed two-storey single-detached  dwelling with a 2-car attached garage.  The subject property is located at 30 McGowan Dr and is zoned Low Density  Residential (LD) within Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  In Support of Application:    None at this time.  In Opposition of Application:   None at this time.   The applicant was not present at this time.   K. Docherty made a motion to move this item to the end of the meeting.   Carried.                                         Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   A/11/25  Richard Vink (VA3 Design Inc.)  28 McGowan Dr   An application has been received from Richard Vink of VA3 Design Inc. (on behalf of  3425 Coronation Developments Limited) for a variance from the provisions of Town of  Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.   The application is for permission to reduce the minimum required frontage for a single  detached dwelling containing an attached 2-car garage from 10.5 m to 9.6 m.   The requested variance is required to permit a proposed two-storey single-detached  dwelling with a 2-car attached garage.  The subject property is located at 28 McGowan Dr and is zoned Low Density  Residential (LD) within Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  In Support of Application:    None at this time.  In Opposition of Application:   None at this time.   The applicant was not present at this time.   K. Docherty made a motion to move this item to the end of the meeting.   Carried.                         Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   B/05/25  Yaso Somalingam   72 Meadow Cres   An application has been received from Yaso Somalingam (on behalf of Emmanuel  Neranjala) for consent at 72 Meadow Cres.  The application is to permit the severance of a 72 Meadow Cres into 2 lots. The  proposed severed lands will measure 728 m2 and the proposed retained lands will  measure 728 m2. Each lot is proposed to have a 2-storey single-detached dwelling.   This application is related to minor variance applications A/12/25 and A/13/25 to permit  the proposed lot sizes for the retained and severed lands.   In Support of Application:    Jonathan Benczkowski (Owner Representative)            Yaso Somalingam (Applicant/Owner Representative)            Larkshana Yasotharan (Owner Representative)  In Opposition of Application:   Brian Pratt (Resident)            Karen Pratt (Resident)            Bernard Lewis (Resident)  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.   J. Benczkowski introduced himself as a Planner representing the owner and provided a  brief presentation on the proposal, the requested severance, and the requested  variances. J. Benczkowski presented examples of neighbouring properties and  explained that the proposed lot sizes and dwelling designs for the subject property are  similar to and compatible with what currently exists in the neighbourhood. J.  Benczkowski also presented a rendering demonstrating the proposed massing next to  the approximate massing of the neighbouring dwellings.  The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.  J. Cardwell asked if any consideration was made to build bungalows instead of 2-storey  dwellings.  J. Benczkowski responded that bungalows were not considered as the proposed  dwellings fully comply with the Zoning By-law's provisions, including the applicable  height restrictions.  K. Docherty asked for clarification on the current lot dimensions and on how many  dwellings are proposed.    Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   J. Benczkowski responded that the lot currently measures 38 m in depth and 38 m in  width. J. Benczkowski clarified that 2 2-storey dwellings are proposed and that the  rendering showed 4 dwellings as it included the neighbouring dwellings. The rendering  served to provide more context on the scale and massing of the proposed dwellings  relative to the neighbouring properties.  K. Docherty asked if the dwellings are mirror images of each other.  J. Benczkowski responded yes. J. Benczkowski further stated that the applicant is  flexible should the Committee impose a condition that the 2 dwellings shall not be mirror  images of one another.  K. Docherty agreed that a condition could be imposed to make both dwellings have  unique designs. K. Docherty stated that the architectural designs should be based on  what already exists in the neighbourhood and that the proposed dwellings should match  the existing aesthetics in the area.  N. Chornobay asked for clarification on what is meant by 'mirror images' and what  changes could be proposed to the designs.  J. Benczkowski responded that the 2 proposed dwellings are currently identical  massings and have identical facades, however, that each dwelling can be give given  different facades and fenestration, as well as different materiality. J. Benczkowski  further explained that because no variances were required to allow the proposed  dwellings, they do not have to resubmit any plans and reapply for more variances if they  change the appearance of the proposed dwellings.  N. Chornobay asked Planning Staff if the Town offers architectural control.  J. Malfara responded that for developments that only require a building permit,  architectural control is not a requirement, unlike for subdivisions or site plan  applications.   There were no further questions from the Committee.   The Chair asked R. Chow, Secretary-Treasurer, if any correspondence had been  received in relation to the subject application.  R. Chow advised the Committee that 4 emails were received in objection of the  proposal, and that these emails were forwarded to the Committee for their consideration  prior to the hearing.   The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.   Brian Pratt and Karen Pratt introduced themselves as residents of the neighbourhood  living across the street from the subject property. B. Pratt stated that more homes in the  neighbourhood are smaller older bungalows than larger newer homes. B. Pratt further   Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   explained that the severance done at 52 Meadow Cres a few years ago was not  appreciated by many community members as the newer homes altered the look of the  neighbourhood. B. Pratt stated that he was concerned the proposal for 72 Meadow  would not fit the look of the neighbourhood either, while also increasing traffic on a quiet  street with no curbs.   K. Pratt stated that while she understands that smaller lots are now more common than  in the past, among the nearby lots that were previously severed, none contain large 2- storey dwellings. The larger homes in the area have larger setbacks as well. K. Pratt  further stated that due to the slope of the street, the proposed 2-storey dwellings will  appear even taller than their actual height.  B. Pratt stated that the applicants of 52 Meadow Cres had also initially proposed 2- storey dwellings but that they revised their plans and ended up building bungalofts. B.  Pratt expressed that the proposal for 72 Meadow Cres feels different compared to the  development at 52 Meadow Cres as well as the other existing properties in the area. B.  Pratt acknowledged that while change will come into their neighbourhood in the future,  the applicant should be mindful and careful of how their proposal will affect those living  around the subject property.   Bernard Lewis introduced himself as a resident of the neighbourhood and stated that he  agreed with B. Pratt and K. Pratt's comments. B. Lewis stated that the homes in the  middle of Meadow Cres are bungalows while the larger homes in the area are located  along the perimeter of the neighbourhood backing onto green space and parks. B.  Lewis expressed that the proposed 2-storey dwellings will stand out among the adjacent  bungalows and destroy the image of the area. The proposal should be revised similar to  how the previous development at 52 Meadow Cres revised their application from taller  dwellings to bungalofts.  N. Chornobay stated that while he is ready to make a motion for approval, he is aware  of the concerns from the community regarding design and that a condition of approval  should be added to consider the design of the future dwellings.   The Chair asked if such a condition should be imposed on the severance application or  if it should be imposed on the related minor variance applications.  R. Chow responded that the severance application is solely to implement the severance  of the lot, not to permit the construction of any dwellings. If a condition of approval for  the severance were to be related to the design of the proposed dwellings, the applicant  would not be able to complete the severance without progressing on the development of  the dwellings. However, the 2 dwellings would not be permitted to be built without a  completed severance. Any condition related to design should therefore be placed on the  minor variance applications instead.  K. Kram responded that a design-related condition of approval should be placed on the  minor variance applications rather than the consent application. Severance conditions   Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   are only applicable prior to the applicant creating the new lots, while minor variance  conditions remain on a lot in perpetuity.   N. Chornobay stated that the Committee should then apply a design-related condition of  approval on the related minor variance applications rather than on the severance  application.  Moved by: N. Chornobay.   That the application to permit the severance of 72 Meadow Cres to create a lot  measuring 728 m2 in area and to retain a lot measuring 728 m2 be Granted subject to  the following conditions:  1. That the applicant satisfies all the requirements of the Regional Municipality of  Durham concerning the provision of regional services, financial and otherwise;   2. That the applicant satisfies the requirements of the Soil and Groundwater  Assessment Protocol by completing and submitting a Site Screening  Questionnaire signed by a Qualified Professional (QP);   3. That the applicant obtains any required minor variances to ensure compliance  with Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784;  4. That the applicant pays the required Release Fees to the Town of Whitby;   5. That the applicant provides a cash contribution to the Town of Whitby for the  planting of one street tree in the boulevard of the proposed severed lot in the  amount of $550. If the boulevard cannot accommodate a street tree, a tree will  be planted on Town land elsewhere in the Town of Whitby;   6. That the applicant shall provide cash-in-lieu of parkland in accordance with  Bylaw 7733-21 and the Planning Act;   7. That the applicant submits two copies of a registered plan on the subject  parcel;   8. That the consent be subject to the following periods:   \u2022 Last date for fulfilling Conditions and the Expiry Date of Application  B/05/25 is Monday, March 22, 2027;  9.  That prior to the signing of the certificate by the Secretary-Treasurer of the  Committee of Adjustment that the consent has been given, the Secretary- Treasurer is to be advised in writing by the Region of Durham that condition  #1 has been carried out to its satisfaction;  10. And that once all the conditions contained in the Committee's Decision are  fully satisfied by the applicant, the applicant's solicitor must prepare and   Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   forward the legal document(s) with the applicable stamping fee to the Town of  Whitby, to the attention of the Secretary-Treasurer of the Committee of  Adjustment for review and approval with stamping. The document(s) will be  returned to the solicitor for registration purposes. Failing receipt by the  Secretary Treasurer of the Deed Package by the requisite date, the  application shall be deemed expired and shall lapse.  Carried  Having considered the contents of all submissions, the staff report, and oral  submissions had an effect on the Committee's decision.                                         Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment       A/12/25 and A/13/25  Yaso Somalingam   72 Meadow Cres   Two applications have been received from Yaso Somalingam (on behalf of Emmanuel  Neranjala) for variances from the provisions of Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.   Application A/12/25 is for permission to (1) reduce the minimum required lot area from  925 m2 to 728 m2 and (2) reduce the minimum required frontage from 21.5 to 19.1 m at  72 Meadow Cres (Part 2).  Application A/13/25 is for permission to (1) reduce the minimum required lot area from  925 m2 to 728 m2 and (2) reduce the minimum required frontage from 21.5 to 19.1 m at  72 Meadow Cres (Part 1).  The requested variances are required to permit reduced lot sizes in relation to Land  Division application B/05/25. 72 Meadow Cres is proposed to be severed into 2 lots to  accommodate a two-storey single-detached dwelling on each proposed lot.  The subject property is located at 72 Meadow Cres and is zoned Residential Type 2  (R2) within Town of Whitby Zoning By-law 1784.  In Support of Application:    Jonathan Benczkowski (Owner Representative)            Yaso Somalingam (Applicant/Owner Representative)            Larkshana Yasotharan (Owner Representative)  In Opposition of Application:   Brian Pratt (Resident)            Karen Pratt (Resident)            Bernard Lewis (Resident)  The Chair introduced the application and asked if anyone would like to speak to the  subject application.   J. Benczkowski introduced himself as a Planner representing the owner and provided a  brief overview of the requested variances. J. Benczkowski explained that the requested  variances are to permit the proposed lot sizes, however, that the proposed dwellings are  in compliance with the Zoning By-law.   The Chair asked if there were any questions from the Committee.    Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of Committee of Adjustment   K. Docherty asked the Committee is any restriction should be placed on the height of  the proposed dwellings, or such a condition would not be possible.  N. Chornobay expressed that conditions could be imposed that would ensure that the  architectural design of the proposed dwellings would be similar to other existing  dwellings in the neighbourhood. N. Chornobay stated that limiting the height would not  be possible as the Zoning By-law permits the heights of the proposed dwellings.  J. Malfara stated that the heights of the proposed dwellings comply with the Zoning By- law as of right. A condition for architectural review could be imposed if desired by the  Committee. Such a review would take place prior to the issuance of a Building Permit.  J. Benczkowski stated that they are flexible with designing unique facades for each  dwelling rather than making the dwellings mirror images of one another.  The Chair asked if there was anyone from the public who wished to speak to the subject  application.   Karen Pratt introduced herself as a resident and asked the Committee how they got the  past applicants of 52 Meadow Cres to redesign their proposed dwellings from a 2-storey  dwelling to a bungaloft.  The Chair responded that the applicants of 52 Meadow Cres had done that on their own  volition due to feedback from the community.   K. Pratt expressed her understanding that the community will grow and that new homes  need to be built, but that she hopes that the proposed dwellings will be similar to the  existing single-storey dwellings in the neighbourhood.  Brian Pratt introduced himself as a resident and asked if the Committee would consider  the safety of their neighbourhood. B. Pratt stated that the neighbourhood has no curbs  and no sidewalks, and that adding an extra home could increase traffic making the  street less safe for young children.  N. Chornobay responded that safety is considered, however, that Meadow Cres is not a  through street and is relatively quiet for an urban area.  K. Docherty responded that she understands the residents' concerns, however, due to  provincial policies favouring intensification, many new developments are difficult to  prevent. K. Docherty suggested that residents write letters to the builder to further voice  their concerns about the style of dwelling that will be built at 72 Meadow Cres.  B. Pratt responded that the Committee should impose a condition for architectural  control.  Bernard Lewis introduced himself as a resident and stated his agreement with K. Pratt  and B. Pratt's comments. B.

PURPOSE  Pursuant to subsection 88.34(1) of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996, the clerk is required  to review the contributions reported on the financial statements submitted by candidates  pursuant to section 88.25 of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996 to determine whether any  contributor appears to have exceeded any of the contribution limits established by section  88.9 of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996, and prepare a report identifying each  contributor who appears to have contravened any contribution limits.  The Clerk's Report identified Nicola Cortellucci (the \"Contributor\") as a contributor that  appeared to have exceed the $5,000 contribution limit to any two or more candidates  under subsection 88.9(4) of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996.

DECISION  On reviewing the Clerk's Report and the written submissions of the Contributor, and on  hearing the presentation of the Town Clerk, and on considering the provisions of the  Municipal Elections Act, 1996, it is the decision of the Committee not to commence a legal  proceeding against the Contributor pursuant to subsection 88.34(8) of the Municipal  Elections Act, 1996.

The Committee is of the opinion that commencing a legal proceeding against the  Contributor would not be in the public interest.  Although the Contributor exceeded  the maximum contribution limit, the Committee accepts the Contributor's  acknowledgment of his error and expression of sincere apology.  4. On that basis, the Committee has decided not to commence a legal proceeding  against the Contributor.  53224813.1     Town of Whitby  NOTICE OF DECISION    THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY  COMPLIANCE AUDIT COMMITTEE  established pursuant to Section 88.37 of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996      IN THE MATTER OF the Town of Whitby Clerk's Report dated May 31, 2023, \"Apparent  Contravention of Contribution Limit \u2013 Kenneth Rovinelli\" (the \"Clerk's Report\");  AND IN THE MATTER OF a Meeting of the Compliance Audit Committee (the  \"Committee\"), held Wednesday, May 31, 2023.

This exceeds the maximum  contribution limit by $50.00.             2. The Committee was advised by the Clerk that the Contributor was provided notice  of the Clerk's Report and the Meeting through multiple methods.  The Contributor  did not provide any written submissions or materials to the Committee in response  to the Clerk's Report, nor was the Contributor in attendance at the Meeting.  The  Committee briefly stood down to afford the Contributor additional time to attend.  3. The Committee is satisfied that the Contributor has exceeded the maximum  contribution limit to two or more candidates.  Despite this, the Committee is of the  opinion that commencing a legal proceeding against the Contributor would not be  in the public interest.  The Committee considers the amount of the  overcontribution, being $50, to be de minimus.   4. On that basis, the Committee has decided not to commence a legal proceeding  against the Contributor.  53225217.1     Town of Whitby  NOTICE OF DECISION    THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY  COMPLIANCE AUDIT COMMITTEE  established pursuant to Section 88.37 of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996      IN THE MATTER OF the Town of Whitby Clerk's Report dated May 31, 2023, \"Apparent  Contravention of Contribution Limit \u2013 Harpreet Taggar\" (the \"Clerk's Report\");  AND IN THE MATTER OF a Meeting of the Compliance Audit Committee (the  \"Committee\"), held Wednesday, May 31, 2023.  PURPOSE  Pursuant to subsection 88.34(1) of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996, the clerk is required  to review the contributions reported on the financial statements submitted by candidates  pursuant to section 88.25 of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996 to determine whether any  contributor appears to have exceeded any of the contribution limits established by section  88.9 of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996, and prepare a report identifying each  contributor who appears to have contravened any contribution limits.  The Clerk's Report identified Harpreet Taggar (the \"Contributor\") as a contributor that  appeared to have exceed the $5,000.00 contribution limit to any two or more candidates  under subsection 88.9(4) of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996.   The Committee held a meeting on Wednesday, May 31, 2023 at 10:30 a.m. to consider  the Clerk's Report.  DECISION  On reviewing the Clerk's Report and on hearing the presentation of the Town Clerk, and  on hearing the oral presentation of Onkar Taggar, agent for the Contributor, and on  considering the provisions of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996, it is the decision of the  Committee not to commence a legal proceeding against the Contributor pursuant to  subsection 88.34(8) of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996.  REASONS   The reasons for the decision are as follows:  1. The Clerk's Report identified that the Contributor made five separate contributions  to candidates on Town Council, totalling $6,000.00.  This exceeds the maximum  contribution limit by $1,000.00.             2. The Committee notes that this matter deals with substantially the same facts as  two other matters before the Committee regarding other individuals who also  appear to have contravened the maximum contribution limit.  3. Mr. Onkar Taggar appeared as agent on behalf of the Contributor. Mr. Taggar  advised that the Contributor is his brother's daughter in-law.  4. Mr. Taggar confirmed for the Committee that the Contributor did in fact make the  five contributions identified in the Clerk's Report.  5. Mr. Taggar advised that the Contributor was not aware of the $5,000.00  contribution limit to two or more candidates.  Mr. Taggar advised that when the  Contributor was approached by candidates to contribute to their campaign, the  Contributor was advised about the $1,200.00 limit to one single candidate, but was  never advised of the $5,000.00 limit to two or more candidates on the same  council.  6. The Committee notes that pursuant clause 88.22(1)(r) of the Municipal Elections  Act, 1996, candidates have a duty to ensure that contributors are informed of the  maximum contribution limits applicable to both one single candidate, and to two or  more candidates on the same council.  7. On Mr. Taggar's advisement, the Committee is satisfied that the Contributor was  not aware of the maximum contribution limit to two or more candidates at the time  of the contributions, but is now aware of the limit.  Mr. Taggar also advised that it  is the Contributor's intention not to overcontribute in future elections.  8. The Clerk also advised the Committee that the Contributor does not have a past  history of apparent contraventions in the Town.   9. The Committee is satisfied that the Contributor has exceeded the maximum  contribution limit to two or more candidates.  However, the Committee is satisfied  on the record before it that the Contributor was not aware of the $5,000.00  maximum contribution limit to two or more candidates on the same council, nor  was the Contributor informed by candidates of this limit.  The Committee also notes  that the Contributor does not have a history of contraventions, but is now aware of  the maximum contribution limit.  10. On that basis, the Committee has decided not to commence a legal proceeding  against the Contributor.  53226317.1     Town of Whitby  NOTICE OF DECISION    THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY  COMPLIANCE AUDIT COMMITTEE  established pursuant to Section 88.37 of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996      IN THE MATTER OF the Town of Whitby Clerk's Report dated May 31, 2023, \"Apparent  Contravention of Contribution Limit \u2013 Karamjit Taggar\" (the \"Clerk's Report\");  AND IN THE MATTER OF a Meeting of the Compliance Audit Committee (the  \"Committee\"), held Wednesday, May 31, 2023.

In response to  a question from the Committee, Mr. Taggar also clarified that the two different  addresses associated with the Contributor were a home address and a business  address.  5. Mr. Taggar advised that the Contributor was not aware of the $5,000.00  contribution limit to two or more candidates.  Mr. Taggar advised that when the  Contributor was approached by candidates to contribute to their campaign, the  Contributor was advised about the $1,200.00 limit to one single candidate, but was  never advised of the $5,000.00 limit to two or more candidates on the same  council.  6.

The Committee also notes  that the Contributor does not have a history of contraventions, but is now aware of  the maximum contribution limit and has indicated that she will respect the  provisions of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996 in the future.  10. On that basis, the Committee has decided not to commence a legal proceeding  against the Contributor.  53227450.1         Town of Whitby  NOTICE OF DECISION    THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF WHITBY  COMPLIANCE AUDIT COMMITTEE  established pursuant to Section 88.37 of the Municipal Elections Act, 1996      IN THE MATTER OF the Town of Whitby Clerk's Report dated May 31, 2023, \"Apparent  Contravention of Contribution Limit \u2013 Onkar Taggar\" (the \"Clerk's Report\");  AND IN THE MATTER OF a Meeting of the Compliance Audit Committee (the  \"Committee\"), held Wednesday, May 31, 2023.
